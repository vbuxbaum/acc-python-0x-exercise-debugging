LYRICS:
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think
So I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?

Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift
Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among knows possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without did you make it?
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes

I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides

For me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Cracker Island

On cracker Island it was born
To the collective of the dawn
They were planting seeds at night

To grow a made up paradise
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
But it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult) 
in end I had to pay (what world is this)
In the end I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end I had to pay (I drank to riot) 
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)
 
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x 2 
Fantasies 

What world is this? x2

On cracker island it was raised
By the collective from the grave
It only came out at night 
It ate up their paradise (paradise)
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
And it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult)
In the end I had to pay (what world is this)
Out there on my silverlake (I was not there)
In the end it will be great (beneath the hills)
I’m like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)
I held on I survived (there in the void)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x2
Fantasy

On cracker island It will die (forever cult)
Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
And on a shining boat of light (forever cult)

Go up to paradise (what world is this) 
Where the truth is autotuned (I purged my soul)
And it’s sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
Into my formats everyday (I drank to riot)
In the end I had to pay (forever cult)

In the end I’ll have to pay (forever cult)
In the end I’ll be ok (forever cult)

Nothing more to say x3

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics: 
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Well separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up
And brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I gotta take it on the otherside

Well centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind

I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long
Will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full
And I’m spillin' my guts
She want to know
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm-push the trigger
And I pull the thread

I gotta to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride
Burn me out
Leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it’s born again

How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever had

(How long)
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

Lyrics: 
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it

Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight

Lyrics: 
Oh, oh

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, ""Hell, yes""
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you

Lyrics: 
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiacbut I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go,blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Ah-ah-ah

Lyrics: 
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah

Lyrics: 
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown

Won't see what might have been

So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

Anticipation
In domination 
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing 
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation 
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Lux Æterna

Emancipation 
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike 
Amplification 
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Light it

“‘Screaming Suicide’ addresses the taboo word of suicide. The intention is to communicate about the darkness we feel inside. It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another, I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Robert Trujillo

ABOUT BTS 
BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or “Beyond the Scene,” is a GRAMMY-nominated South Korean group that has been capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013. The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.

↓ LYRICS ↓

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Lyrics:
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Lyrics:
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Lyrics:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within(I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(It's like)It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Lyrics:
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)Confusing what is real

Lyrics:
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

About the The Razor's Edge:
AC/DC cracked the seal on the '90s with one of the best riffs of their career. That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

Lyrics:
All you women who want a man of the street
Don't know which way you wanna turn
Just keep coming
And put your hand out to me
Cause I'm the one who's gonna make you burn
I'm gonna take you down
Down down down
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it pull it
Pull the trigger
Shoot to thrill play to kill
Too many women too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill play to kill
I got my gun at the ready gonna fire at will

A girl that's a natural killa (Prr)
I wanna girl that's a heater (Hot)
Caliente, off the meter (Hot)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero
Una chica que no me diga mentiras

So they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me

Ah-ah-ah, you're lookin' for

Oye, mami, estoy buscando una chica así
Oye, mami, estoy buscando una chica así
Ah-ah-ah, you're lookin' for

Me llevas en tu mente
Soy adictiva como el azúcar
Me buscas permanentemente

Latinas, latinas
La-La-Latinas, la-la-latinas

Sacúdelo como, Shaki
Baby, drop it low on top me

Your hips don't lie, they rock me
Baby, come get me, you got me
Oye, mami, ven aquí
You know I'm liking what I see

Una princesa no tiene pa' ver
Esa chick with no boundaries like that fue what ev'

So they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
Oye, mami, estoy buscando una chica así

We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo

Ritmo 

No son ni Reebok ni son Nike (No)
Sin estilista luzco fly (Yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (Woo)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (Nah)
Soy próspero y tengo claro que e' mi culpa (Mi culpa, culpa)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi base y la paz no me la tumban (Woo)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters pa' la tumba, nosotros pa' la rumba (Ra)

This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo 

Ritmo

The rhythm, the rebel
Styles upon styles upon styles, I got several
Born to be wild 'cause I live like a daredevil
Live it up, hit ‘em up, that’s the scenario 
2Pac, I get around like a merry go 
Rooftop, I am on top of the pedestal 
Flu shot, I am so sick I need medical 
Puta, I learned that shit down in Mexico (Hahaha!)
The rhythm, the rebel
New and improved I be on a new level (Oh, yeah)
That’s how we do it, we buildin’ like LEGOs (Oh, yeah)
Fuel on the fire, you dealin' with fuego
Can't stop, I am addicted I never quit
Won't stop, don't need to speak to no therapist
Don’t stop, keepin' it movin's the narrative
Nonstop, do it like Whoop! There it is 

This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

Toda la noche rompemo' (The night)
Al otro día volvemo' (Oh, yeah)
Tú sabes como lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (The night)

From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Billie Jean"" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""Billie Jean"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

When the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen, director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. ""It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The ""Billie Jean"" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked ""Billie Jean"" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It.""

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Bruce Gowers
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Rock With You"" was the second of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in the United States in 1980, topping Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts and reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart that same year.

""Rock With You"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 1980, and Platinum of February 14, 1989. The song was ranked No. 82 on Rolling Stone and MTV's list of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs in 2000. In his 1988 memoir Moonwalk, Michael called ""Rock With You,"" written by Rod Temperton, ""the sort of thing I was aiming for"" in creating an album to his vision.

The short film featured Michael performing the song on a plain stage in a sequined jumpsuit and matching boots, a set of shimmering lasers illuminating his outfit from behind. Director Bruce Gowers praised Michael as ""an absolute professional"" in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 2014, the magazine would rank ""Rock With You"" No. 6 on a list of Michael Jackson's 20 Greatest Videos.

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Nick Saxon

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was the first of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in eight countries in 1979, topping Billboard's Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot Disco Singles charts as well as the Cash Box Top 100.

""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 29, 1979, and Platinum on February 14, 1989. The song won Michael his first solo Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1980, as well as his first American Music Award for Favorite Single (Soul/R&B). ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was ranked No. 9 on the 100 Best Songs of the '70s by NME and No. 16 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs.

""That song means a lot to me because it was the first song I wrote as a whole,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' was my first big chance, and it went straight to Number One. It was the song that won me my first Grammy. Quincy had the confidence in me to encourage me to go into the studio by myself, which I appreciated.""

The short film featured Michael in performance against a dazzling background of geometric shapes and patterns. Wearing a tuxedo similar to his outfit on the Off the Wall album cover, Jackson sings and dances to the song, at one point even dancing with two other clones of himself, achieved through the magic of special effects.

You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch youfixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won'tyou come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!""",True,True,502735560

Lyrics:

Ever wonder about what he's doing?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try""",True,True,476783121

Lyrics:

I guess I just lost my husband,
I don't know where he went,
So I'm gonna drink my money,
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope),
I got a brand new attitude and
I'm gonna wear it tonight,
I wanna get in trouble,
I wanna start a fight,

Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight,
Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight.

So, so what
I'm still a rock star,
I got my rock moves,
And I don't need you,
And guess what,
I'm having more fun,
And now that we're done,
I'm gonna show you tonight,
I'm alright,
I'm just fine,
And you're a tool,
So, so what,
I am a rock star,
I got my rock moves,
And I don't want you tonight""",True,True,471672024

“Cover Me In Sunshine”
 
I’ve been dreaming 
friendly faces
I’ve got so much time to kill
 
just imagine 
people laughing
I know some day we will
 
and even if it’s far away
get me through another day
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
from a distance 
all these mountains
are just some tiny hills
 
wildflowers 
they keep living 
while they’re just standing still 
 
I’ve been missing yesterday 
but what if theres a better place
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
La la la 
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine

Lyrics:

You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh
That's right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew""",True,True,219363750

Nate Dogg [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO],Mydełko,1931315.0,18992.0,291.0,"‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around
Like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",False,False,1548871694

Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you

It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Lyrics: 

2X
No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un dia fuimos
y lo peor es que 

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

De repente no eras el mismo
me dejaste por tu narcisismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos 

Tu distante con tu actitud 
y eso me llenaba de inquietud 
tú no daba ni la mitad 
pero sí sé que di más que tú 
estaba corriendo por alguien       
que por mí ni estaba caminando 

Este amor no muerto pero esta delirando
ya de lo que había ya no hay na
te lo digo con sinceridad 
tu estas frío como en Navidad 
es mejor que esto se acabe ya 
no me repita la movie otra vez que esa ya la vi 

Bebe yo te quiero pero es que yo me quiero más a mí 
es un adios necesario 
lo que un día fue increíble se volvió rutinario
no me saben a nada tus labios 
ahora es todo lo contrario 
y lo peor es que

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos (ambos)
eh eh eh (ambos)

Lyrics:
Por completarte me rompí en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron, pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebalsó el vaso

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Esa filosofía barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto
La gente de dos caras no la soporto
Yo que ponía las manos al fuego por ti
Y me tratas como una más de tus antojos
Tu herida no me abrió la piel, pero sí los ojos

Los tengo rojos de tanto llorar por ti

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Y ahora resulta que lo sientes
Suena sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas (Ey, dice, Ra-Rauw)

[Verso 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Hablándote claro, no te necesito (Yeah)
Perdiste a alguien auténtico (Ah)
Algo me decía por qué no fluiamo' (¡Wuh!)
Te va a picar cuando recuerde’ cómo nos comíamo' (¡Yah!)
Como ante' (Ey)
Tú de espalda apoyándote del volante (Ey)
Quemando el tranquilizante
No te bloqueé de las rede' pa' que vea' la otra en la Mercede' (¡Yah!)

[Puente: Shakira]
No me cuente’ más historia’, no quiero saber
Cómo es que he sido tan ciega y no he podido ver
Te deberían dar un Oscar, lo has hecho tan bien

[Coro: Shakira & Rauw Alejandro]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
hasta en tu propio país
Si yo te digo ¿Como dices tu?
Tu aún dices ¿Que decis?
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón""",True,True,138360843

Lyrics:
Si es cuestion de confesar
No se preparar cafe
Y no entiendo de futbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parques
Y jamas uso reloj
Y para ser mas franca nadie
Piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te de lo mismo
Si es cuestion de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que tambien
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio
Conmigo nada es facil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amandote es inevitable
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hayque hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo""

Lyrics:
2,3,5!
 
Maybe If I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There’s shadows on the wall, wish I would’ve ran
Gotta get away I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man 
Maybe I’ll be gone before you count to 10
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Maybe if we went another way
I wouldn’t be regretting the decisions that I made
I don’t want to spend another day
Looking for somebody that I know I can’t replace
My tears fall you don’t miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history 
I think I’m broke and nothing can fix me
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Yeah
We were built to fall apart
But I can’t feel you now
And it’s too late now there’s no point screaming
Dug your grave so fuck your feelings
No one’s here so now you’re on your own
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last

LYRICS

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home, someone take me
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feets, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hooome, hooome
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hoooome, hooome
Look, I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever
Just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the
Devil in the face and make it home safe
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Hoooome, hooome (take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me

Lyrics:
Screaming when we fuck
Screaming when we fight yeah
Even when I’m drunk
You’re my only type yeah
 
Please don’t break my heart
I know that you might yeah
Tell me tell me now,
are you bout that life? yeah
 
Bonnie & Clyde 
ready to die 
Two
Gravesites 
later tonight 
you
Told me to stop waiting
I can feel your back breaking
Face down 
lay pipe
Water works 
swim your pool
Backstroke we both naked 
I can see that ass shaking
Damn yeah 
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
  
I love chaos I love toxic
I love wreckage I love falling
Pics you’re taking pics you’re cropping
It’s hard lately I’m exhausted
You hate my guts then you love me
You make me feel so disgusting
Can’t stop a runner from running
So go, go, go
You’re my only drug
You’re my only vice yeah
Fighting then we fuck
You’re my only type yeah
Mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessey
All I’ve got’s this broken heart but you can have the rest of me
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
 
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying

It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stone like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

Letra de EQUIS ""X"" 

Aquel día te vi y tu energia sentí
Desde eso no te quiero lejos de mi
Sé que no sabes de mi y no te puedo mentir
Lo que dicen en la calle sobre mi

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar (no te lo puedo negar)
Estamos claros y ya (estamos claros, estamos claros)

Solo deja que yo te agarre baby
Besos en el cuello pa' calmar la sed
Mi mano en tus caderas pa' empezar como es
No le vamo' a bajar mas nunca mamá

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Lo que he visto de ti mami no me es normal
Pero no te preocupes que soy anormal
Sé que tus amigas no les debo gustar

Pero ve y cuentale parte por parte
Como tenemos sex y te quito el estres
Dale otra vez

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba- Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

The Avengers.

(Intro)
Lenny: Desde que estábamos en la high escribías mi nombre en tu cuaderno. 
Yo pienso en ti cuando estoy high.
Y ahora picheas pa’ comernos (vamos a vernos). 

Sech: Dame un ratito y más na’ (más na’). 
Después si quieres no te escribo más na’ (más na’).
Parezco Google buscándote.
Quiero hacer una serie que se llame “toda la noche dándote”. 
Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

(Coro)
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Sech: Te digo cuándo, hora y dónde pasa. 
Que le pague a la gente de Waze.
Pa’ que borren el location de mi casa.
Vendo noviecito cuernudo a la brasa. 
Y si mi plan fracasa mañana vuelve y pasa. 
Acuérdate cuando lo hicimos. 
En el carro, en la cocina, esta serie no termina.
Baby te tenía siempre encima. 
Piensa en un número, ya te lo imaginas.

Nicky Jam: Me dice que me vaya. 
Me pide que me quede.
Tú siempre estás jugando. 
Contigo no se puede.
Hasta que te me trepas encima, yeah. 
Te pongo disciplina, yeah.
Nunca la dejo caer. 
Siempre me pide otra vez. 
Otra vez la tengo llamándome. 
No se olvida de cómo la traté. 
Que los planes todos se los cambié. 
Y su novio ahora se volvió su ex. 

Lenny: Hey, mañana avísame si acaso te demoras.
Pa' enseñarte cómo una pussy se devora.
Una nueve-seis al revés, tú sabes como es.
En menos de una hora.

Shorty
Yo sé tus problemas con los jumper 
No te cabe el bumper. 
Yo entro en ese party.
Di que vas con tus amigas sola. 
Que en mi cama hay un party. 

Justin: ¡Ay Justin Quiles mami!
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cuando te lo hacía. 
Cómo te venías. 

Sech: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Justin: ¿Qué fue te dio alzheimer?
Se te olvidó todas las veces que te comía en el driveway.
De desayuno, de cena.
Te batía la maizena.
Y ahora le dices que no estuve en la escena.
Para.
Deja de estar metiendo fecas.
Si te lo hice hasta dentro de la discoteca.
Por facetime te ponía a hacer caras.
Y tú te tocabas.

Feid: Dime cuándo nos tomamos el Old Fashion. 
Ponme un caption. 
Y al novio tuyo le ponemos los cachos. 
Yo quiero repetir la dosis.
Tú que no y yo que sí. 
Otro en el jacuzzi. 
Suave. 
Que tu gato ya no puede vernos pa’ comernos.
Siempre tenemos que escondernos.
Qué chimba, como en el colegio. 
Mami si te llamo es pa’ poder hacerlo.

Dalex: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Rafa Pabón: Rafa Pabón
Vamos a repetirlo, tres, seis.
No hay que decirlo. 
Dime si quieres sentirlo.
Es que no es lo mismo oírlo que vivirlo.
Si lo subes mami tienes que disminuirlo.
Encima, trépate, como en el colegio.
Acuérdate. 
Quería pichar y del parque se la saqué.
Todos sus trucos ya los anoté. 
Y a su gato se la quité.

Dalex: En la cama se guayó.
Tus poses favoritas el que las sabe soy yo.
Fui un sniper, en tu cuerpo el que nunca falló.
No tiene que aceptarlo pero sé que fui yo, fui yo.

Sech: Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Lyrics:
Si te preguntan qué pasó entrenos
Que eso se quede entre nosotros dos
No des la versión tuya
Porque eso no me ayuda

Si ni tan malo fui (eh)
Pa’ que hables mal de mi (eh)
Si no es bueno, no digas nada
Y si te cuesta quedarte callada

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Ahora me tienes como el malo del cuento a mi
Después que mi corazón completo te lo di
No te pido que regreses
Pero cuando lo beses
No puedas dejar de pensar en mi

Sé que me escucho egoísta
Pero siento que lo mío me lo quitan
De protagonista te quedó el papel
Jugando un juego donde solamente gana el, pero

Diles también que yo soy el único
Que a ti te eriza la piel
Y te pudo complacer
Cuando ‘toy borracho pienso
En todo lo intense
Que tú y yo
Tuvimos en aquel viejo hotel

Just let me know, nena
Si nada te llena
Muero, vuelvo y nazco y gano de cualquier manera
Just let me know nena
Cuando tú quieras
Te hago el amor como si nada pasó
Roooyce
Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Y si te
Preguntan en tu casa
Usa más la cabeza
Luego yo con qué cara voy a beber con tu pai cerveza
Tu mai que tanto me ama
No vaya a ser que me odie
Si se entera lo que hice
Puede que no me perdone

Está cabrón lo sé
Lo nuestro lo maté
Pero fueron más cosas buenas que contigo pasé
Ayer entré a ver tus fotos
Y encontré una de nosotros
Quizás tú quieres volver
A la verdad que ‘toy loco

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Abbey Road presented with new mixes in stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos; expanded with previously unreleased session recordings and demos.
 
Super deluxe 4 disc set, 3 LP deluxe vinyl, 2 CD deluxe, limited edition picture disc, CD, LP, digital and streaming. Available everywhere September 27, 2019.
 
On August 8, 1969, the world’s most famous band stepped out from London’s EMI Recording Studios to stride, single-file, across the black and white stripes of Abbey Road’s nearby zebra crossing. With photographer Iain Macmillan balanced on a stepladder and one policeman stopping the street’s light traffic, The Beatles crossed back and forth three times, led by John Lennon, followed by Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Just six photos were taken, with the fifth selected as the cover shot for The Beatles’ penultimate studio album, Abbey Road, named after the tree-lined street in which the studios are located.
 
Released September 26, 1969, Abbey Road was not The Beatles’ final album, as Let It Be followed in 1970, but it was the last one John, Paul, George, and Ringo recorded together as a band. The Beatles celebrated Abbey Road’s anniversary with a suite of beautifully presented packages released worldwide on September 27, 2019 by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe. Now available, the album’s 17 tracks are newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo, high res stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos, accompanied by 23 session recordings and demos, most of which are previously unreleased.

Lyrics:
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best, (That's right) you've ever had (That's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am (Yeah)
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball
Fireball

Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky, jogue lá no alto)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side, lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from, we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola

Letra/Lyrics:
Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around (Daddy Yankee!)
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down (Mr Worldwide!)

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar (Play-N-Skillz!)
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar (Let’s ride)
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Pit verse

That money, that money, that money we get it
And if it’s bout billions you know that we with it
And if it’s that fire, you know that we get it
Yankee, Pit, we don’t rap it we live it
Siempre somos los dueños del juego
Billones, billones, empezamos de zero
Esto no para, esto sigue, sigue
Dale Yankee dile, dile…

DY verse
(Fuego!)
Dinero Dinero ese ha sido el enfoque
Querido en el mundo y amado en los bloques
Yo creo en la higiene los chavos pal’ pote
Lavando el dinero me hice un bichote
Puré pa’ la calle lo que tiro es puro
Toa’ la familia ya estamos seguros
Los tiempos duros no duran para siempre
Los que duran para siempre son los duros.

Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Sean Paul ft J Balvin- Contra La Pared (SPANISH)

J Balvin part:

De día y de noche me llama 
Que quiere de nuevo en mi cama 
No fue suficiente una vez 
Y ahora de día y de noche reclama 

Cucara macara di que fue 
Ya me tienes contra la pared 
Pide una vez pide dos pide tres 
Otra vez llegamos hasta diez 

Se ennota 
se fuma sola la huka 
se pide un trago de fruta 
Yo se como es que disfruta
Como le gusta 

Se ennota 
Se quita sola la ropa 
Se da otro shot a las rocas 
Se que todo le provoca cuando se aloca

Sean’s part : 

Night & day!
Want me in her bed! 
Ooh yeah! That’s what she said!

Because I set to the fire to thing when I gave her one time, 
She lovin’ it so much she have it pon speed dial,
Eye them a meet & Mi give her two times, deso when me start see the girl a get wild, 
Three time Mi give her the wickedest wine, she lovin’ that style and she love the profile,
Four time mi give her that grind (not sure about this first part)
Loco Losing her mind,
Fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego!
Anytime she want me to set it on fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego!

Anytime she wah to get it she call me, anytime she wah collect it she call me! See the fire hose deh , me wet it, she call me! 
Cause she know me nah pet it, she call me! Gyal say she just can’t forget it! 
Night & day!
Wah me in a her bed! Oh yeah!
That’s what she said!
Say she want one more chance!
Otra vez! Llego mustard yes! 

She might as well be attached to me, now she can’t go a day without chat to me, said she love the way mi give her love naturally, 
And she can’t stay away, snap back to me, she gridlock to me, 
Fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego! 
Anytime she want me to set it on fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego! 
Gyal say she just can’t forget it!
Night & day! She Wah me in her bed! That’s what she said!




Sean Paul ft J Balvin- Contra La Pared (ENGLISH)

J Balvin part:

Day and night she calls me
What do you want in my bed again
It was not enough once
And now, day and night, he claims

Cucara macara di that was (cucara macara is more an onomatopoeia and not a WORD)
You already have me against the wall
Ask once asks for two requests three
Again we get to ten

It is noted
the hookah smokes alone
a drink of fruit is requested
I know how she enjoys
As you like

It is noted
She takes off her clothes alone
Another shot is given to the rocks
I know that everything provokes him when she goes crazy

Sean’s part : 

Night & day!
Want me in her bed! 
Ooh yeah! That’s what she said!

Because I set to the fire to thing when I gave her one time, 
She lovin’ it so much she have it pon speed dial,
Eye them a meet & Mi give her two times, deso when me start see the girl a get wild, 
Three time Mi give her the wickedest wine, she lovin’ that style and she love the profile,
Four time mi give her that grind (not sure about this first part)

Lyrics:
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on our green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

#ElvisPresley #IfICanDream #ElvisMovie #ElvisSoundtrack #ElvisLive #ElvisComebackSpecial #Elvis1968 #IfICanDreamLive

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

[Verse 2]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear


[Bridge]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)

[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

[Outro]
Let it come true right now
Oh, yeah",True,True,19601041

Lyrics:

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that Sunshine State where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, shake it baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it, Cali
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house

Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

California love, yeah
California knows how to party
California knows how to party

Tupac Amaru Shakur born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac, Makaveli, and Pac, was an American rapper and actor. As of 2007, Shakur has sold over 75 million records worldwide. His double disc albums All Eyez on Me (1996) and his Greatest Hits (1998) are among the best-selling albums in the United States. Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time, and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including Rolling Stone, which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On April 7, 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Shakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer, and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist. Most of the themes in Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism, and other social problems. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs. During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant during the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers, and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and the label Bad Boy Records. Apart from his career in music, Shakur was also an actor, starring in various films and TV programs in the 1990s, including Poetic Justice (1993), Gang Related (1997) and Gridlock'd (1997).

On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died from his injuries six days later.


Although Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's ""Same Song"" from the soundtrack to the 1991 film Nothing but Trouble, and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground extended play (EP) This Is an EP Release, the follow-up to their debut hit album Sex Packets. Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album Sons of the P. Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track ""I Get Around"", which ranked #11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

In November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, 2Pacalypse Now. Though the album did not generate any ""Top Ten"" hits, 2Pacalypse Now is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli having pointed to it as inspiration. Although the album was originally released on Interscope Records, the rights to its distribution are now owned by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now.

2Pacalypse Now generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs ""Trapped"" and ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, ""There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society."" Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, ""I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang,"" Shakur said. ""I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. 

His second studio album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the Billboard 200. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While 2Pacalypse Now had an indie-rap-oriented sound, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... is generally considered Shakur's ""breakout"" album. It spawned the hits ""Keep Ya Head Up"" and ""I Get Around"" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1–8) was labeled the ""Black Side"" and Side B (tracks 9–16) the ""Dark Side"". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.",False,False,211103197

TRADUZIONE TESTO

[Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
Non ho paura, niente affatto
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
Io non ho paura
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
Non ho paura del buio
Del buio, mmm

[Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
Non ho mai paura e non sono mai inorridito
Ho appena guardato il mio Rolex, ha detto che sono i tempi più bui
Non sono mai terrorizzato, non sono mai pietrificato
Sai che vedo dei morti, li dico solo ""Fatti una vita""
Non ho mai “paura”, non sono sicuro che sia una parola, ma
Intendo ogni parola, sentendomi come ""non disturbare"", aspetta
Lasciami testimoniare, non ho mai testimoniato
E sono sposato con il mio orgoglio, non ho mai, mai pianto
Ho gli occhi come biglie, se piango brillano
Sai che posso leggere la tua mente come se fossi l'autore
C'è una linea per domani e quella linea si sta accorciando
Sono dietro il grilletto, e se fossi il bersaglio?
Profondo sospiro, un sayōnara, non ho paura di morire
E’ addio o buongiorno, e il cielo inizia a cadere
E io sto risplendendo nell'oscurità
Ripenso al mio Rolex, dice ""Tempo per il coro""
Sai che non ho paura

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Io non ho paura
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Del buio, mmm
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Si, si, si, si

[XXXTENTACION]
Si
Ok, metti il mio cuore da parte
Nei miei sentimenti, cavalchiamo
Grossa MAC di fianco
Se lei chiama, scivolerò
""La mia piccola"" Amico, sei pazzo
Potrebbe ottenere una nuova Mercedes
Lei dice che mi vuole, oowee
Ok, piccolina, facciamolo, uh-huh

[XXXTENTACION]
Se potessi contare le lacrime che ho versato
Un milione di volte, giuro che sono morto
Ci sto provando, ma non va ancora bene
L'unica volta che la voglio è di notte

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai  paura del buio?
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura (Sì, sì, sì, sì)

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

Don't cry snowman, not in front of me
Who will catch your tears if you can't catch me, darlin'?
If you can't catch me, darlin'?
Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas baby
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey?
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby?
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas baby
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

#ABBA #DancingQueen #Remastered

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen 

Friday night and the lights are low 
looking out for the place to go 
where they play the right music, getting in the swing 
you come to look for a king 

Anybody could be that guy 
night is young and the music’s high 
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine 
you’re in the mood for a dance 
and when you get the chance 

You are the Dancing Queen 
young and sweet only seventeen 
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
you can dance, you can jive 
having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen 

You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on 
leave ’em burning and then you’re gone 
looking out for another anyone will do 
you’re in the mood for a dance 
and when you get the chance 

You are the Dancing Queen 
young and sweet only seventeen 
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah 
you can dance, you can jive 
having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen

Lyrics:

Half past twelve 
and I’m watchin’ the late show 
in my flat all alone 
how I hate to spend 
the evening on my own 
autumn winds 
blowin’ outside the window 
as I look around the room 
and it makes me so 
depressed to see the gloom 
there’s not a soul out there 
no one to hear my prayer 

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
won’t somebody help me 
chase the shadows away 
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
take me through the darkness 
to the break of the day 

Movie stars 
find the end of the rainbow 
with a fortune to win 
it’s so different from 
the world I’m living in 
tired of TV 
I open the window 
and I gaze into the night 
but there’s nothing there to see 
no one in sight 
there’s not a soul out there 
no one to hear my prayer 

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
won’t somebody help me 
chase the shadows away 
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
take me through the darkness 
to the break of the day

#ABBA #Waterloo #Remastered

Lyrics:

My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender 
oh yeah, and I have met my destiny 
in quite a similar way 
the history book on the shelf 
is always repeating itself 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger 
oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance 
is giving up the fight 
and how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

So how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose – 

Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

The original studio version of ‘My Way’ was recorded on December 30, 1968 in one take. ‘My Way’ has gone on to become an all-time classic, a song which will be forever associated with the Chairman of the Board, as one of his signature tunes, and one which Frank Sinatra regularly closed his live shows with.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The audio and video of this is ""out of sync."" The audio and video are from two different sources. But, at least you can get an idea of how they look singing this #1 hit together.


""Somethin' Stupid,"" also known as ""Something Stupid,"" is a song written by C. Carson Parks. It was originally recorded in 1966 by Parks and his wife Gaile Foote, as Carson and Gaile. The song is best known in the 1967 version by Frank Sinatra and his daughter Nancy Sinatra, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2001, a cover version by British vocalist Robbie Williams and Australian actress Nicole Kidman reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.


Nancy Sandra Sinatra (born June 8, 1940)] is an American singer and actress. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy (Barbato) Sinatra, and is widely known for her 1966 signature hit ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"".

Other defining recordings include ""Sugar Town"", the 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), the title song from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood such as ""Jackson"", ""Summer Wine"" and her cover of Cher's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"". She appeared on TV in high boots, and with colorfully dressed go-go dancers, creating a popular and enduring image of the Swinging Sixties. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including ""Some Velvet Morning"". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.

Sinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-1960s, including a co-starring role with Elvis Presley in the movie Speedway, and with Peter Fonda in The Wild Angels. In Marriage on the Rocks, Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter.


The Wrecking Crew is a 2008 American documentary film directed by Denny Tedesco, son of the great guitarist Tommy Tedesco. It covers the story of the Los Angeles–based group of session musicians usually known as “The Wrecking Crew,” famed for having played on numerous hit recordings throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The film premiered at the 2008 “South by Southwest” Film Festival.  It was not released theatrically until 2015.

Popular music of the 1960s was dominated by young bands like the Beach Boys, the Mamas & the Papas, Jan and Dean, and the Monkees. Listening to rock and roll on jukeboxes and car radios created devoted fans of these groups, whose music communicated the optimism and sorrow of a generation contending with strong countercultural forces.

Record companies happily supplied the public with new songs and musical groups, all packaged with artistic photographs and biographical profiles.

Left out of the story was an important historical fact: the bands, in some, but not all, cases, did NOT play the instruments heard on their records. Instead, the task of recording the perfect tempo, pitch, and timbre fell to a small group of accomplished session musicians.

The Wrecking Crew documents the work of studio players who recorded the tracks for such hits as ""California Dreamin'"", ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"", ""Be My Baby"", ""The Beat Goes On"", and ""Good Vibrations""  Interviews with producers, engineers, and session musicians reveal the warmth and humor that allowed their collective talents to turn a simple chord chart into an international phenomenon.",False,False,182673374

LYRICS
——————————————————————
Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Mama pls don’t worry bout me 
Cause I’m about to let my heart speak 
My friends keep telling me to leave this 
So let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Back and forth 
Back and forth  
with the bullshit 
I know I said it before 
I don’t mean it 
It’s been a while since I had your attention 
so it might hurt to hear this  

Dreams we have don’t ever fall away 
but we can’t live em if we stay the same  
And I can’t do this for another day 
So let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business",True,True,980693352

Lyrics: 
You won’t see me crying on the bathroom floor
I ain’t never coming back for more
Wanna see you walking out that door
Bye bye bye bye 
You won’t see me begging for a second chance
Say I need you cos it don’t make sense
Boy you just lost a ten out of ten
Won’t lie lie lie
 
Tonight I’m gon be rockin it
Droppin it
Shake my ass no stoppin it
I look hot in it
Hot in it 
I look hot in it
 
Movin’ ‘til my feet get sore
Hands all on me ‘til my dress gets torn
Watch me do it do it real hardcore, my my my
You and me we never ever made much sense
I’m too independent no offense boy
Don’t be sad about the things I said
Don’t cry cry cry
 
Tonight I’m gon be rockin it
Droppin it
Shake my ass no stoppin it
I look hot in it
Hot in it 
I look hot in it

Lyrics:
La arena
 
Imagínate
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar
El sonido de las olas
Recorriendo todo tu cuerpo
Bésame
Tócame
 
Y baila conmigo
 
La arena
 
Pasa su mano
Por todo mi cuerpo
Lentamente
Bailamos al ritmo del Tïesto
 
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar
El sonido de las olas
Recorriendo
 
Imagínate
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar
 
Bésame
Tócame
 
Y baila conmigo

“‘Jackie Chan’ came together pretty spontaneously. Dzeko and I have been friends with Post for some time. When we met Preme in Las Vegas, he showed us the vocal he and Post had been working on and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to collaborate. I’m really excited to put this out for you all to hear. We’ve definitely created a summer anthem with this one.”

LYRICS:
She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

Drop top how we rollin’ down on Collins South Beach
Look like Kelly Rowland, this might be my destiny.
She want me to eat it, I guess dinner’s on me.
Know I got the sauce, like a fucking recipe.

She just wanna do it for the ‘gram
She just want this money in my hand.
Ima give it to her when she dance dance dance.
She gon’ catch an Uber out to Calabasas.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan

I think you got the wrong impression bout me baby, (bout me baby)
Just cause they heard what hood I’m from, they think I’m crazy (they think I’m crazy)
OK, well maybe just a little crazy (just a little)
Cause I admit I’m crazy bout that lady, yea, yea

Finger to the world, it’s fuck you pay me. (I been slavin’)
Run the pussy, cause I’m running out of patience. (no more waitin’)
No, no, bouncing like a yo-yo, 
Livin’ life on fast-forward, but we fuck in slo-mo. (yea)

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

I can’t wait for the show, oh, oh.
Got that good yea, I know, oh, oh.
You should not be alone, oh, oh
All this drink got me throwed, oh, oh, oh.

Club got me right, and I feel so alive
She don’t want a thing, she don’t wanna be no wife.
She just wanna stay all night, she just wanna sniff the white.
Can’t tell her nothing, no can’t tell her nothing, no.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.",True,True,782756255

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

Lyrics:
Build a fire and gather ‘round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me
 
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas
 
We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 
 
The fire is raging on
And we’ll all sing along to the songs
Just having so much fun
While we’re here can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone
Merry Christmas everyone

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe 
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas

We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 

I feel it when it comes
Every year helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas everyone
 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas

""Ahora te Puedes Marchar""

Letras:
Si tú me hubieras dicho siempre la verdad
Si hubieras respondido cuando te llamé
Si hubieras amado cuando te amé
Serías en mis sueños la mejor mujer
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Si tú superas lo que yo sufrí por ti
Teniendo que olvidarte sin saber por qué
Y ahora me llamas, me quieres ver
Me juras que has cambiado y pensas en volver
Si no supiste amar ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Compositores: Luis Gomez Escolar / Ivor Raymonde / Mike Hawker

""La Incondicional"" 

Tú, la misma siempre tú
Amistad, ternura, que se yo.

Tú, mi sombra has sido tú
La historia de un amor
Que no fue nada.

Tú, mi eternamente tú
Un hotel, tu cuerpo y un adiós.

Tú, mi oculta amiga, tú
Un golpe de pasión
Amor de madrugada.

No existe un lazo entre tú y yo
Nada de amores
Nada de nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La incondicional
La que no espera nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La que no supe amar
No sé porqué.

Tú, intensamente tú
Soledad, cariño yo que se
Tú, mis horas bajas, tú.

Un cuerpo de mujer
Un par de rosas blancas.

No existe un lazo entre tú y yo
No hubo promesas
Ni juramentos
Nada de nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La incondicional
La que no espera nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La que no supe amar
No sé porqué.

""La Media Vuelta""

Te vas porque yo quiero que te vayas
A la hora que yo quiera te detengo
Yo sé que mi cariño te hace falta
Porque quieras o no
Yo soy tu dueño

Yo quiero que te vayas por el mundo
Y quiero que conozcas mucha gente
Yo quiero que te besen otros labios
Para que me compares
Hoy, como siempre

Si encuentras un amor que te comprenda
Y sientas que te quiere más que nadie
Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Yo quiero que te vayas por el mundo
Y quiero que conozcas mucha gente
Yo quiero que te besen otros labios
Para que me compares
Hoy, como siempre

Si encuentras un amor que te comprenda
Y sientas que te quiere más que nadie
Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde
Te vas porque yo quiero que te vayas

""Por Debajo de la Mesa""

Por debajo de la mesa
Acaricio tu rodilla y bebo
Sorbo a sorbo tu mirada
Angelical y respiro de tu
Boca esa flor de maravilla
Las alondras del deseo
Cantan, vuelan, vienen, van

Y me muero por llevarte
Al rincón de mi guarida
En donde escondo un beso
Con matiz de una ilusión
Se nos va acabando el trago
Sin saber qué es lo que hago
Si contengo mis instintos
O jamás te dejo ir

Y es que no sabes lo que tu me
Haces sentir
Si tu pudieras un minuto
Estar en mi
Tal vez te fundirías
A esta hoguera de mi sangre
Y vivirías aquí y yo abrazado a ti

Y es que no sabes lo que tú
Me haces sentir
Que no hay momento que
Yo pueda estar sin ti
Me absorbes el espacio
Y despacio me haces tuyo
Muere el orgullo en mi
Y es que no puedo estar sin ti

Me absorbes el espacio
Y despacio me haces tuyo
Muere el orgullo en mi
Y es que no puedo estar sin ti

""Tengo Todo Excepto A Ti""

Se ve que no te voy
Se ve que no me vas
Se ve que en realidad
Solo me quieres
Como a un amigo más
Como algo de siempre.

Ya ves, me equivoqué
Creía que era feliz
Pensaba que yo lo tenía todo
Tantos amigos, caprichos
Amores locos.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y el sabor de tu piel
Bella como el sol de abril
Que absurdo el día en que soñé
Que eras para mí.
Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y la humedad de tu cuerpo
Tu me hecho porque sí
Seguir las huellas de tu olor
Loco por tu amor.

Se ve que no te voy
Se ve que no me vas
Pues tengo todo
Menos tu mirada
Y sin tus ojos
Mis ojos ya no ven nada.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y el sabor de tu piel
Bella como el sol de abril
Que absurdo el día en que soñé
Que eras para mí.

Me sobra juventud
Me muero por vivir
Pero me faltas tu.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y la humedad de tu cuerpo
Tu me has hecho por que si
Seguir las huellas de tu olor
Loco por tu amor.

""No Sé Tú""

No sé tú
Pero yo no dejo de pensar
Ni un minuto me logro despojar
De tus besos, tus abrazos
De lo bien que la pasamos la otra vez

No sé tú
Pero yo quisiera repetir
El cansancio que me hiciste sentir
Con la noche que me diste
Y el momento que con besos construiste

No sé tú
Pero yo te he comenzado a extrañar
En mi almohada no te dejo de pensar
Con las gentes mis amigos y las calles
Sin testigos

No sé tú
Pero yo te busco en cada amanecer
Mis deseos no los puedo contener
En las noches cuando duermo
Sin imsomnio yo me enfermo
Me haces falta mucha falta
No sé tú

No sé tú
Pero yo te busco en cada amanecer
Mis deseos no los puedo contener
En las noches cuando duermo
Sin imsomnio yo me enfermo
Me haces falta mucha falta
No sé tú

Solitaria camina la bikina
La gente se pone a murmurar
Dicen que tiene una pena
Dicen que tiene una pena que la hace llorar

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Pasa luciendo su real majestad
Pasas caminas nos miras sin vernos jamás

La bikina
Tiene pena y dolor
La bikina
No conoce el amor

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Dicen que alguien ya vino y se fue
Dicen que pasa las noches llorando por él

¡Mi Mariachi!

La bikina
Tiene pena y dolor
La bikina
No conoce el amor

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Dicen que alguien ya vino y se fue
Dicen que pasa las noches llorando por él

Lyrics:

I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.",True,True,836260550

I’m one of one
I’m number one 
I’m the only one
Don't even waste your time
Trying to compete with me 
No one else in this world can think like me 
I'm twisted  
I’ll contradict it
Keep him addicted 
Lies on his lips, I lick it  
  
Unique 
That’s what you are 
Stilettos kicking vintage crystal off the bar 
Category  
Bad bitch
I’m the bar 
Alien Superstar
Whip, whip

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm
Too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love
Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love

Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind their haute couture
Label whores can’t clock I’m so obscure 
Masterpiece genius, drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist 
Tiffany blue billboards over that ceiling 
We don’t like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes 
Mile high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again
You see pleasure in my glare 
Look over my shoulder and you ain’t scared 
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow hike it in the air

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby
U-N-I-Q-U-E
U-N-I-Q-U-E

I got pearls beneath my legs my lips my hands my hips 
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss 
Can’t find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss 
Fire beneath your feet 
Music when you speak you’re so 
Unique

That’s what you are 
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar 
Category 
Sexy bitch, I’m the bar  
Alien superstar

We just reaching out to the solar
System, we flying over
Bullshit we flying over  
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit Casanova
Superstar, supernova
Power pull ‘em in closer
If that’s your man then why he over here?

Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Lyrics:

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
(chorus)
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you make everything stop.
Finally you put my love on top.",True,True,524847088

On stage rockin’ I’m stir crazy 
Cocoa flow like 1980’s
Come let’s tell a drop lazy
None of that maybe 
Energy, energy, energy 

Just vibe
Voting out 45, don’t get outta line
Pick a side
Only double lines we cross is dollars signs
Hold up 
Wait, I hear you just got paid make it rain
Energy

She more Cancun he more Saint Tropez
Big wave in the room and the crowd gon’ move
Look around everybody on mute
Look around it’s me and my crew
Big energy

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

Gold links, raw denim
You know that we do it grande
You know that I’m gon’ be extra
When that camera go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Keep ‘em waiting like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Ooo la la la  
That’s the way dem boys sound when I walk through the block, block, block
Then I uzi that doozy shot, shot, shot

We was just chillin’ minding our business
Popping our pain and champagne though the ceiling
Sipping it up, flicking it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I’m crazy, I’m swearing, I’m daring, your man’s staring
I just entered the country with derringers
Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Con Calma Letra:
Cómo te llamas baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa’ mi
Dile a tus amigas que andamos ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party

Cómo te llamas baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa’ mi
Dile a tus amigas que andamos ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiero que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl
Tiene adrenalina en medio de la pista vente hazme lo que sea
I like your “poom poom” girl 

Ya vi que estás solita acompáñame
La noche es de nosotros tú lo sabes
Que ganas me dan dan dan
De guayarte mami ese rampampam! Yeah!
Esa criminal como lo mueve es un delito
Tengo que arrestarte porque empiezo y no me quito
Tienes criminality pero te doy fatality
Vívete la película flotando en mi gravity
Daddy pone las reglas tienes que obedecer
Mami no tiene pausa qué es lo que vas hacer?
Échale échale échale pa’ tras
Échale échale  pa’ lante y pa’ tras

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiere que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl
Tiene adrenalina en medio de la pista vente hazme lo que sea
I like your “poom poom” girl 

Tú tienes candela y yo tengo la vela
Llama al 911 se están quemando las suelas
Me daña cuando la faldita esa me la modela
Mami estás enferma pero tu show no lo cancelas
Te llaman a ti la reina del party
Mucha sandunga tiene ese body
Tírate un paso no no pare wow dale dale!
Somos dos bandidos entre la rumba y romance
Zúmbale dj otra vez pa’ que dance
Échale échale échale pa’ tras
Échale échale pa’ lante y pa’ tras

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiere que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl
Tiene adrenalina en medio de la pista vente hazme lo que sea
I like your “poom poom” girl 

Come with a nice young lady
Intelligent, yes she gentle and irie
Everywhere me go me never lef' her at all-ie
Yes-a Daddy Snow me are the roam dance man-a
Roam between-a dancin' in-a in-a nation-a

Lyrics
I finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (evidence)
It's evident that you ready to rock (ready to rock)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (ready to hide)
Swangin' on the corner, bang my TEC 'til it pop (TEC 'til it pop)
I thought I was a goner, blaze to your honour
Burn marijuana, teeth diamond designer
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (evidence)
It's evident that you ready to rock (ready to rock)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (ready to hide)
Swangin' on the corner, bang my TEC 'til it pop (TEC 'til it pop)
I thought I was a goner, blaze to your honour
Burn marijuana, teeth diamond designer
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
I'm finna stand tall (tall)
I'm all (all)
You be on my back like a cardigan (cardigan)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (evidence)
All (all)
I'm all (all)
You be on my back like a cardigan
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence

Official “Honest” Lyrics:

Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) 
Find you in the cut
I copped it (I copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song)

Off top you the sun in my morning 
I tried to get away but its boring 
You’re my safe haven
I need it all alone
And you my dime piece
And I can’t take less than one

You the (whew)
You the one
Trinity you like three in one 
Ratio ten to one

You get spicy
I like that cajun on you 
On occasion
That’s your testimony

I like that hazel on you
I look straight in your eyes 
Holy matrimony

Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) Find you in the cut
I copped it (copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song)

Yeah honest
Spicy I like it
Facetime me the weed I just might buy it
Throw it back on the couch I just might try (Ohhhh spicy) 
Damn that booty thick
I like it
Hey Justin B
I know you don’t do this often 
But this here sneak and geek 
Fuck that Mclaren
Im ridin the jeep
I got in the club with all of my thugs
Im packing that pistol Pete
Better watch your mouth
Gotta pick a side before you jump and leap
I was selling thee nickels and dimes in dubs 
But crack in my sock it ain’t me
But baby I like it
Imma pull that double R to your crib just for once 
It’s 23 when you get dunked 
Me and JB smokin skunk

Oh honest
Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) 
Find you in the cut
I copped it (I copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song) Oh honest

Lyrics to Mystery Lady
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 1
In this life I come across fans and hoes and I like to give my fans a rose curse of the talented everywhere I go
they wanna change clothes and pose
But my wife be in my dreams bruh no I couldn’t see her
I saw her silhouette.
I know I can make her wet but when I wake up alone
I just break out my phone
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong
am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 2 [Don Toliver]
Thinkin I could make this many songs about My lady she be havin me up and down
I be in my feelings, sometimes I be jealous But I keep it thuggin like It’s Macavelli
Ring ring hit my celly
Remember you went bad on me I won't forget it. You say that you gon tell on me
No don’t you tell it
In between the sheets you know i got you Yellin

Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 3
Could it be monogamy ain’t meant for me nah
that’s way too Reckless I’d get too jealous
could she be from the east or overseas nah
I learned my lesson I’m way to Western could she be my favorite ethnicity I’m just I’m undressing all of these sections of my thoughts
thinkin thinkin thinkin thinkin too hard
but I really wanna know
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.

Letra:

Si por cosas del destino
Un día tú y yo nos despedimos
Ay, yo no sé qué comería
O de qué me reiría
Porque el mundo sin ti no me lo imagino

Si por cosas de la vida
Llega el hombre que por fin te merecías
Y si él es tu alma gemela
Yo me quito aunque me duela
Y hasta dos o tres consejos le daría

No te preocupes por mí
Yo me las arreglaría
Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía
Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti

Y aunque te den el doble de caricias
Y el triple de los besos que te di
Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día
Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti
Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero
Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad
De lo que yo a ti te quiero

No te preocupes por mí
Yo me las arreglaría
Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía
Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti

Y aunque te den el doble de caricias
Y el triple de los besos que te di
Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día
Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti
Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero
Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad
De lo que yo a ti te quiero
De lo que yo a ti te quiero

LETRA: 

Desconocidos
Sí, sí

Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con ganas de besarse
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase 
Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con miedo a enamorarse
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Oye oye óyeme bien 
Tú eres lo que busco yo en una mujer 
Te tengo en la mira desde que llegué
Siento que eres mía, yo no sé por qué

Ay, yo sé que es mentira 
Decir que soy el hombre de tu vida 
Si tú ayer no me conocías 
Y no sabías que me querías

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

¡Y la bailamos lentico!

No sé cómo explicar 
Lo que en ti estoy viendo 
Me encanta cómo estás moviéndote 
Tu cuerpo estrella contra mi cuerpo ma

No lo entiendo 
Dime si de mí te estabas escondiendo 
Té tan bella y yo apenas conociéndote 
Bailemos sin importar quién este viendo

Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo 
Yo quiero pasarla bien contigo, contigo 
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo 
Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse (Con miedo a enamorarse) 
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase 
Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con miedo a enamorarse (Con ganas de besarse) 
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Lyrics: 

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Lo siento por los que están en la fila,
Que recojan y empaquen mochila,
Diles que ya te dejen tranquila,
Que yo soy tuyo y tú eres mía.

Agarremo un avión sin saber pa donde,
Busquemos una playa sin tiburones,
Tú y yo besándonos en los rincones,
Y que se vea el mar desde los balcones.

Tengo la lancha alquilada,
Coquito y agua salada,
Dos trajes de baño, dos cervecitas y más nada,
Más nada.

Tengo la lancha alquilada,
Coquito y agua salada,
Dos trajes de baño, dos cervecitas y más nada.

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Si tú estás a lado mío yo no dejaré que nada te destruya, te destruya,
Siete billones de sonrisas en el mundo y a mí me gusta la tuya, solo la tuya.
Lo que siento ya es muy obvio,
El mundo sin ti lo odio,
Y yo creo que ya es notorio, 
que yo quiero ser tu novio.

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Letra de «Si Me Dices Que Sí»

(Lara mercy gang)
(For you my love)

Qué pasa si te digo 
Que yo no te he olvidado
Que no aprendí a vivir sin ti

(Reik)

Qué pasa si esta noche
Jugamos al pasado
Para curar la cicatriz

(Camilo)

¿Qué no daría por besar tu cuello?
¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(Wo)
Es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wa yo, wa yey)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Uh, oh)
Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Lara mercy gang)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Farru)
Si me dices que sí

Tu boca se acuerda 
De mí si la toco
Mi mente no olvida 
Y mi cuerpo tampoco
Tú me enseñaste a amarte
Pero nunca a olvidarte

Dime qué voy a hacer 
Para que tú te quedes aquí
(Eh, eh)
(Dime qué hago)

Si no eres tú no es nadie
(Wu, oh, uh, oh)

Y es así
(Y es así)
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Si no estás me muero)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir
(Ya no quiero vivir)

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
Yo dejo todo por ti
(Uh, oh)
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Lara mercy gang)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Si me dices que sí

Te compro Richard Mille
Te regalo una casa ahí en Beverly Hills 
Pa’ vivi’no’ la movie flow Nicki MeekMilly
Como la serie del patrón somo’ El Topo y El Chili
Inseparables, cómplices apasionados en placer 
Si te lograra convencer 
Para que volvieras otra vez

Y dime que no
Lánzame un sí camuflajeado
Clávame una duda
Y me quedaré a tu lado

¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(¡Farru!)

Y es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wai oh, wah yeh)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Wuo)

Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Si me dices que sí)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(Yeah)
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Qué no daría por besar tu cuello
Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

Lyrics: 

De lejos se ve que tiene el corazón roto,
Yo con solo mirarla lo noto,
Si pa ayudarla hay que anotarse, me anoto,
Yo estoy pa usted, me declaro devoto.

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,
Ay! dígame ahora,
Que yo no la dejo sola.

Ella ahora tiene el corazón hecho pedazos,
Si quieres llorar en mis hombros, te hacen falta brazos, yo te los doy.
Amores como el tuyo están escasos,
Siempre la trato con respeto nunca me propaso,
Sus llamadas no rechazo,
Cupido tiene mala puntería en los flechazos, 
Donde lo vea por ahí le meto un derechazo,
Yo contigo me caso,
Pero estoy consciente que hay que llevarlo paso a paso.
Por ti yo soy capaz de lo no creen, yo te lo demostré, 
Un comportamiento extraño yo le note,
Se reveló con una foto, esa no es usted,
Yo hasta me preocupé.

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,
Ay! dígame ahora,
Que yo no la dejo sola.

Yo se que usted trae broncas con cupido,
Pero no cierre el cora se lo pido,
Usted quiere olvidarlo y no ha podido,
Y ya intentó con todo pero no intentó conmigo.
Hazme caso, relájate en mis brazos,
Que yo te propongo olvidar a ese payaso,
Y si te gusta el arte, aquí te va un Picasso, Muah!

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Letra:
This is the remix
Y me traje a Camilo

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu…

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tú….

Ra’ Rauw

Yo no se ni que hacer (no se)
Cuando estoy cerca de ti
Tus ojos color café
Se apoderaron de mi
Muero por un beso 
De esos que no son de amigos (de esos que no son de amigos)
Me di cuenta que por esa sonrisa yo vivo
 
Camilo
Yo quiero conocerte…
Como nadie te conoce
Dime que me quieres
Pa’ ponerlo en altas voces
Pa’ mostrarte que yo soy tuyo
En las costillas me tatúo…
Tu nombre….

¿Que lo que tienes?
Yo no se
Que me mata y no se porque…
Muéstrame ese tatua'ito secreto que no se ve
Porque tu, tu 
Con ese tattoo, tu
Ta’ pa’ comerte 
Toda, todita bebé (hehe) (todita)

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu… (así estas tu)

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu….

Tu… (tu, tu, tu, tu..)
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu… (así estas tu)

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo… (ese tattoo)
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu…. (no hace fata nada, bebe)

Dice, ey

Es que yo no quiero mas nadie 
Que no seas tu en mi cama
Baby, cuando te despiertes
Levántame antes que te vayas
Solo tu boca es lo que desayuno
Siempre aprovecho el momento oportuno
Como yo no hay ninguno
Déjame ser tu número uno

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu…

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu…. (no hace falta nada, nada) (asi estas tu, baby)

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu…

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu….
No hace falta nada, bebé

Ra’ Rauw Alejandro

Esto es un remix pa’ las nenas malas y buenas

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

Lyrics:
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Letra: 
Gangalee

Ra’ Rauw
¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Farru!
Desde que te vi yo sabía
Que tú ibas a ser mía
Y algo a mí me decía
Que tú eres la baby que tanto quería…

Porque rápido hubo química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba, baiii)

Y gozamos, bebimos, fumamos
Bailamos to’a la noche y en casa terminamos
Todavía no sé cómo se llama
Y tampoco sé cómo terminamos en mi cama

Pero tuvimos química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba)

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar (uoo)

To’as las cosas que pasan por mi mente
En mi habitación, mujer…
Yo dándote
Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Yo calentándote,
Tú calentándome,
Tú dices que tú eres brava, eso lo quiero ver…

Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Sigue bailándome,
Sigue cucándome,
Que te voy a dar duro contra la pared

¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Lyrics:

I’m sorry but
Don’t wanna talk
I need a moment before i go
It`s nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don’t need to see me cry
Cause even when they understand
They don’t understand

So then when I’m finished
I’m all ‘bout my business
And ready to save the world
I’m takin my misery
Make it my bitch
Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Lo siento mucho, pero me voy
Por que a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tu no vez que lo Hago por que te amo

Pero ya, no tengo mas na' que hacer aquí
Me voy, llego la hora de partir
En mi propio camino seguiré lejos de ti

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Letra de «Si Me Dices Que Sí»

(Lara mercy gang)
(For you my love)

Qué pasa si te digo 
Que yo no te he olvidado
Que no aprendí a vivir sin ti

(Reik)

Qué pasa si esta noche
Jugamos al pasado
Para curar la cicatriz

(Camilo)

¿Qué no daría por besar tu cuello?
¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(Wo)
Es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wa yo, wa yey)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Uh, oh)
Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Lara mercy gang)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Farru)
Si me dices que sí

Tu boca se acuerda 
De mí si la toco
Mi mente no olvida 
Y mi cuerpo tampoco
Tú me enseñaste a amarte
Pero nunca a olvidarte

Dime qué voy a hacer 
Para que tú te quedes aquí
(Eh, eh)
(Dime qué hago)

Si no eres tú no es nadie
(Wu, oh, uh, oh)

Y es así
(Y es así)
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Si no estás me muero)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir
(Ya no quiero vivir)

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
Yo dejo todo por ti
(Uh, oh)
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Lara mercy gang)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Si me dices que sí

Te compro Richard Mille
Te regalo una casa ahí en Beverly Hills 
Pa’ vivi’no’ la movie flow Nicki MeekMilly
Como la serie del patrón somo’ El Topo y El Chili
Inseparables, cómplices apasionados en placer 
Si te lograra convencer 
Para que volvieras otra vez

Y dime que no
Lánzame un sí camuflajeado
Clávame una duda
Y me quedaré a tu lado

¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(¡Farru!)

Y es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wai oh, wah yeh)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Wuo)

Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Si me dices que sí)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(Yeah)
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Qué no daría por besar tu cuello
Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Lyrics:
Adios madre mía
Échame la bendición
Perdón por esta agonia
Que causé a tu corazón
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Cuatro de la madrugada entran le rompen la puerta
A la vieja con una orden de arresto
Agentes enmascarados con el chaleco puesto
“Señora entregue a su hijo, ¿O prefiere verlo muerto?”
Mi madre confundida estalla en llanto
Pide misericordia en medio del quebranto
Yo nunca había visto a mami llorar
Pero aun así no paraba de rezar
Al verla así, mis manos levanté
No lo pensé y de una me entregué
Yo le gritaba “¡Madre perdóneme,
Esto no se lo merece usted!”
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Yo tenía un mal presentimiento
De que algo mal iba a salir
Y antes de salir de casa
A mi viejita le pedí
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
Salgo entregao’ puesto pa la vuelta
Si damo’ este palo me toca el 50
La cara tapá’ me enganché la 40
Por si algo sale mal le vacío el de 30
Toy viendo dimareo, una movida rara
Ya mate al contacto porque no nos da la cara
Detras viene una patrulla y si viene y nos para
“Mi libertad no tiene precio, dispara” Para-ra-ra-rapae!
Suenan los fules
Llegan los azules
Tabala tanta sangre no había visto
Si salimos vivos de aquí es gracias a Cristo
Por fin lo conseguimos a base de palos
De donde venimos nadie nos daba la mano
La cara tapada nos encapuchamos
Confío en el de arriba que nunca me ha traicionado
En mi coro no hay chivato’, yeh
Con Los Fedes no hicimos trato
En la calle tengo un contrato’ yeh
Siempre real y nunca sapo, nunca sapo Yeiyeeh
En el coro si hay un chivato
Que con Los Fedes hizo un trato
Por mi cabeza hay un contrato
No son real estos son sapo, estos son sapos
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido

Lyrics:
El Rvssian

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me Convenciste
Que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 

Tu mirada no es confiable
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo 

I’m tryna keep you warm
Quarentining with me for no reason 
Love drunk got me floored
Left your Chanel bag in my Porsche 
I shoulda dropped you off
Memories we repeat every weekend
Lie like this before
You do me when you get bored 
It ain’t no problem 
It’s cool what you doing tonight 
Long as you keep coming and I’m fucking you right
Lil mami amor
Another chance for me to give you what’s yours
And I know that it’s bad
When I let you pull me right back 
Cause you never promise tomorrow 
You give me your love but it’s borrowed 
Lay you down and forget all the past 
Only one that could do me like that 
How you coming and goin is tidal 
You wrapped on my body but I know

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 

Baby se acabo 
Te corté de raíz ahora dónde ponerte decido yo 
Que se muera mi flor 
Difícil me la puso 
Acabo de ver en mi carro que su cartera se quedó
A propósito la dejó 
Siempre pone una excusa pa volverme a ver 
Después que peleamos me lo quiere hacer 
Con solo un beso se me olvidó 
Todo lo que ella me hizo 

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me convenciste 
que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 
Tu mirada no es confiable 
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo

Lyrics:

I need you boo, (oh)
I gotta see you boo (hey)
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight

Hey! Little mama,
Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own
And
Oh, little cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and...

You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do.
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...""

Lyrics: 
[Intro]
Yeah, word to Mazii, n*gga (ah)
F*ck these n*ggas talkin' 'bout, n*gga?
Haha
When they swing that way to the right, you swing to the left, you heard?

[Verse]
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, f*cking your ho in her kidney
F*ck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck and my wrist and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his b*tch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she's f*cking on my brozay
I'm just gon' f*ck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler kick it
F*cked that lil bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, f*ck that b*tch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, b*tch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted
But then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
B*tch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me p*ssy, I need a percentage
If you gon' f*ck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)

[Outro]
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn

Lyrics: 

I'm not tryna be here for a long time
Just, just a good, good time
I got a lot of shit weighin' on my mind
Weighin' on my mind

So f*ckin' serious, you ni*gas' delirious
Said it wit' exclamation, but ni*gas can't f*ck wit' me, period
B*tch, right off the back, I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeros look good on my checks
I got like two or three phones for business and b*tches and still can't even answer a text
Yeah, we in the spot, we won't give it a rest
They be sayin' that that liquor gon' catch up to you
N*gga, it ain't caught up to me yet
I hit the road, I look like the mayor
Countin' up fifties and twentiеs and tens
I'm out of state, they givе me a ten
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
That was the plan again, b*tch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis, it look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spend, I spend, yeah
I don't f*ck wit' her, she fiesty
All of the n*ggas that's wit' me are shiesty
This is the reason these n*ggas don't like me, yeah
I gotta win, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricy
I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna f*ck wit' a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B
I'm on a roll like the motherf*ckin' dice be
I'm catchin' p*ssy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' p*ssy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?

I, I've had way too much to drink, you know, I
1942, it ain't on me, sing to five
Ex callin' up my phone, f*ckin' up the vibe
Tonight's not the night, tonight's not the—
Yeah (Yeah), f*ck that b*tch, yeah (Uh)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick, yeah (Uh)
Louis V belt, yeah (Yeah), Louis V belt, yeah (Uh)

Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote all of the original tracks, as well as producing Carey's interpretations of the covered material. The album contains a contemporary holiday theme, and featured ""authentic, gospel flavored background vocals."" Three singles were released from the album, of which All I Want for Christmas Is You went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time.

Lyrics:
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear, hear the Angels' voices

Lyrics 
ए Bikaaneri chhokri
संतरे ki tokri
Ghar toh छुड़वाया
Ab kya छुड़ायेगी naukri ..
रोिमयों रोिमयों
Gali ke रोिमयों
Bholi shaqal wale
Saare ke saare farebiyon
रोिमयों .. रोिमयों
भाड़े ke premiyon
काहे gale pade ho
Bin bulaaye baaraatiyon
Le toh gayi kaleja
Sang mein hume bhi le ja
Ye toh chori pe
Hai seena zori
Kabhi lage Monalisa
Kabhi kabhi lage lolita
Aur kabhi jaise कादम्बरी

Pardeson tak behne vaali
Mujhe गेहनों se बढ़के
Sapnon ki chaahat hai
Jin sapnon ko sach
Ho jaane ki aadat hai
कट्टी hai meri mardon se
Yaari filmon ke पदोर्ं se

Lyrics:

MUKHDA
Mujhko itna bataaye koi
Kaise tujh se dil no lagaaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banaane mein
Kar di hain husn ki ख़ाली tijoriyaan
 
Kaajal ki 
Siyaahi se likhi 
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan 

[ Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

ANTARA
पतझड़ ke mausam mein bhi
रंगी chanaaron jaisi
Jhanke sannaaton mein tu
Veena (वीना) ke taaron jaisi

Sadiyon se bhi Iambi ye
Man ki amaavasein hain
Aur to phuljhadiyon vaale
Tyohaaron jaisi ..

Chanda bhi deevaana hai tera
Jalti hain tujhse
Saari chakoriyaan 

Kaajal ki
Siyaahi se likhi
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan

[Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

Song Lyrics :

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Ho Feel me 
Shining in the shed in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and heal me, O Heal me 

Thinking about the love n making The Life for sharing 
Come and feel me O feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Come on Heal me.. 

Hua Jo tu bhi mera Mera, Tera Jo ikrarr hua 
To kyun na mein bhi, Keh dun keh dun 
Hua mujhe bhi Pyaar hua 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, O Feel me 
Shining in the shade in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and Heal me.. O Heal me.. 
umm waise to maan mera 
Phele bhi raaton mein 

Aksar hi chahat ke haan, Sapne Sanjota tha 
Phele bhi dhadkan yeh, Dhoonn koi gaati thi 
Par abb jo hota hai who, Phele na hota tha 
Hoona hai Tujhe jo bhi jo bhi 
Mujhe bhi is paar hua

To kyun na main bhi keh doon keh doon 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hua
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Aankhon se chhoon lu k baahein tarasti hain 
Dil ne pukaara hai haan, Ab to Chale aao 
Aao k Shabnam ki Bundein Barasti hain 
Mausam Ishaara hai haan... 
Ab to Chale aao!!
Baahon mein Daale Baahein Baahein 
Baahon ka Jaise haar hoona.. 
Haan Maana maine maana maana... 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hoona 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Thinking about the love n making entire Life for sharing 
Come and feel me, Ho Heal me

Lyrics:
MALE-
Chingariyan ye jo mere seene mein hain dafan
Inko zara deke hava ban jaaun main agan

Dahek raha hai banke sharara dekh mera badan
Sab kuchh mera karke fanaa karta hoon main havan

Om Deva Deva

Om Deva Deva
Om Deva Deva namaha…
Namaho Namah Om

Mehsoos ख़ुद ko maine kiya jab tu ne chhua
Om Deva Deva
Om Deva Deva namah

Namaho Namah Om

ANTARA- 1
FEMALE-
Ishq humara nahin ye fitoor hai 
Rishta purana koi toh zaroor hai

Aake mile hain usi ke toh vaaste 
Ye raaste .. ye raaste

MALE-
Tu hai havaon ka jhonka main aag hoon
Tu raagdaari hai meri main raag hoon

Main jee raha hoon tere intezar mein
Aavaaz de .. aavaaz de

TERI SARAAYE dhoondh raha tha mera banjaara man

Sab kuch mere karke fanaa
Karta hoon main havan

Om Deva Deva
Om Deva Deva namah
Namaho Namah Om

Om Deva Deva
Om Deva Deva namah
Namaho Namah Om

Mehsoos ख़ुद ko maine kiya...
Jab tune chhua

Gali ke रोिमयों
Bholi shaqal wale
Saare ke saare farebiyon
रोिमयों .. रोिमयों
भाड़े ke premiyon
काहे gale pade ho
Bin bulaaye baaraatiyon
Le toh gayi kaleja
Sang mein hume bhi le ja
Ye toh chori pe
Hai seena zori
Kabhi lage Monalisa
Kabhi kabhi lage lolita
Aur kabhi jaise कादम्बरी

Pardeson tak behne vaali
Mujhe गेहनों se बढ़के
Sapnon ki chaahat hai
Jin sapnon ko sach
Ho jaane ki aadat hai
कट्टी hai meri mardon se
Yaari filmon ke पदोर्ं se

It was released as a single in 1980 with ""Hey You"" as the B-side. The music was composed by guitarist David Gilmour, and lyrics were written by bassist Roger Waters.

The Wall is a concept album about an embittered and alienated rock star named Pink. In ""Comfortably Numb,"" Pink is medicated by a doctor so he can perform for a show.

Guitarist David Gilmour recorded a wordless demo, and bassist Roger Waters wrote lyrics, inspired by an experience of being injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps before a 1977 performance in Philadelphia on the In the Flesh Tour. ""That was the longest two hours of my life,"" Waters said, ""trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm."" The song's working title was ""The Doctor"".

For the chorus, Gilmour and session player Lee Ritenour used a pair of acoustic guitars strung similarly to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced with a high E string, two octaves higher than standard tuning. This tuning was also used for the arpeggios in ""Hey You"".

Waters and Gilmour disagreed about how to record the song; Gilmour preferred a more grungy style for the verses. Gilmour said: ""We argued over 'Comfortably Numb' like mad. Really had a big fight, went on for ages."" In the end, Waters' preferred opening and Gilmour's final solo were used.[citation needed]

To write the two guitar solos, Gilmour pieced together elements from several other solos he had been working on, marking his preferred segments for the final take.

**50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINK FLOYD‘S ‘THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON’. OUT MARCH 24**
Announcing the release of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ as a deluxe box set to celebrate 50 years since the release of one of the best-selling albums of all time. Newly remastered, the box set will be released on 24th March 2023. 

One of the most iconic and influential albums ever, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ continues to find new audiences globally. The album was partly developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite at London’s Rainbow Theatre several months before recording began. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in the US on 1 March and then in the UK on 16th March 1973.  The new material was recorded in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road studios) in London. The iconic sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and drawn by George Hardie. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.

The new deluxe box set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the new 2023 remastered studio album and Blu-Ray + DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions.  The set also includes additional new Blu-ray disc of Atmos mix plus CD and LP of ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’. For full details see listing below.

**'THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LIVE AT WEMBLEY EMPIRE POOL, LONDON, 1974’**
Simultaneously, on 24th March, the CD and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’ will be released independently. It was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band’s winter tour and this is the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie.

**ANIMATED VIDEO COMPETITION**
The 50th Anniversary release will also be celebrated as Pink Floyd invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Pink Floyd has a rich history of collaborating with animators from the beginnings of the band (Ian Emes, Gerald Scarfe etc.), and in some cases the visuals that accompany the songs have become synonymous with the music itself. The 50th Anniversary will be no exception. The band would like to give all animators an opportunity to present a fresh take on these timeless aural works. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album. A winner will be selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is November 30th 2023. To enter and for more information go to https://www.pinkfloyd.com/competition/

**PINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: 50TH ANNIVERSARY BOOK**
The book Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon: 50th Anniversary will also be published separately by Thames & Hudson on March 24, 2023 to coincide with the box set release. Curated by photographer Jill Furmanovsky and art directed by Hipgnosis co-founder Aubrey Powell, this LP-sized volume showcases rare and previously unseen photographs taken during The Dark Side Of The Moon tours of 1972-1975 and was created with the involvement of the band members.

**NEW PLANETARIUM ALBUM EXPERIENCE ANNOUNCED**
Fifty years on, in recognition of the iconic album and with the help of huge strides in technology, an official full dome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond and played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon, will be released in Planetariums around the world in March. Contact your local Planetarium for any screening details.

The show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Lyrics: 
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

#GreenDay #Nimrod25 #GoodRiddanceTimeOfYourLife

Lyrics: 
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life...

Lyrics: 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Lyrics: 
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Lyrics: 
Say hey!
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Three, four!
""The representative from California has the floor.""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

Lyrics: 
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Passed the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

Jaded:

Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression

The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium

Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere
In nowhere

 Underwater, Einaudi's first full solo piano album for 20 years, is a manifesto for life and a statement for this time when the world around him was quiet and silent.

With 12 beautiful and intimate piano tracks featuring his trademark melodies, the album was written while Ludovico was isolated at his home in Italy, working without any distractions or the usual commitments that come with his busy schedule:

""I felt a sense of freedom to abandon myself and to let the music flow in a different way. I didn't have a filter between me and what came out of the piano, it felt very pure."" – Ludovico Einaudi

Lyrics:
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

LYRICS
I push my fingers into my eyes...
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
But it's made of all the things I have to take...
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...
If the pain goes on...

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact:
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together
Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane!
All I've got...all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!",True,True,525198814

LYRICS
Stapled shut, inside an outside world 
And I'm sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic - closing in 
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections,
I've got no time to lose, and I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt 
I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

My end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road and my end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
THE END OF THE ROAD!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

LYRICS
I did my time and I want out
So effusive - fade - it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done! It has begun! I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all...
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
Venomous, insipid
I think we're done. I'm not the only one!

Psychosocial!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

Fake anti-fascist lie - (psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but - (psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out - (psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season - (psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? - (psychosocial!)
I'm not the only one!

LYRICS
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
Everything is 3D blasphemy 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
This is not the way I pictured me 
I can't control my shakes 
How the hell did I get here? 
Something about this, so very wrong... 
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
Is it a dream or a memory? 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Get outta my head cuz I don't need this 
Why I didn't I see this? 
I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate 
I have sinned by just 
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

You haven't learned a thing 
I haven't changed a thing 
My flesh was in my bones 
The pain was always free 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

And it waits for you!",True,True,297647780

Lyrics:

Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go
 
I’m just weathering a rough patch… another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the Hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it/Pick a Lord and you pray to it
You’re so demanding when you want the truth, but your stories don’t read for me
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go
 
Indecision Overload/Keep a buckle on the Devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God, but did you Think- You’d- Shake- Your- Own?
This Killing Field is all grown over- the Motherfucker wants it wild
Go sew your oats in alphabetical order/the Anti-Antagonist is back- in- style
MYOPIC/Cannot See Straight/DYSTOPIC/One Sin Too Late
You got to lie if you want to believe, but your Bibles don’t work on me
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting… GO
 
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I’m not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more- but you didn’t want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I’m setting you free- I’m setting you free
 
You’ve Killed The Saint In Me
How Dare You Martyr Me
You’ve Killed The Saint In Me
 
Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go

LYRICS
Undo these chains, my friend. I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven.
You and I can’t decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends… some of us are destined to be outlived.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you’re not what you seem.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil…
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Depravation- You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that’s left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you’ll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil… anymore

SO STEP INSIDE/ STEP INSIDE

LYRICS
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, 
And leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage 
For what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...
Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...",True,True,265277606

Lyrics:
Put Your Hands Into The Water- Let Your Mouth Go Sick And Dry
Put Your Life Into Your Death Now- Let Them Sing Until You Die
DIE!

Radical, rather than rhetorical, babble like an Oracle
Why am I always in your debt?
Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost- Communist Comatose
Show me all the wagers are a bet
The middle of a nuclear winter is a modern 
Achievement of the retro apocalyptic horde
Satan, you must be mistaken, there are no more Satans
Only The Bosses on the Board
Forget Deny Ignore Nice Try It’s You
Regret Rely Remorse Inside Of You

Maybe you’ve been down too long…

The Heart Begins To Suffer When The Soul Has Given Up
And The Flesh Is Barely More Than Bone
When No One Else Is Listening- Only When You’ve Had Enough
Time To Sing This Dying Song Alone
Put Your Hands Into The Water- Let Your Mouth Go Sick And Dry
Put Your Life Into Your Death Now- Let Them Sing Until You Die
DIE!

Maybe you’ve been down too long…

Think Hard You Bastards- You’re Gonna Tell Me Why
If I Don’t Get An Answer, You’re Gonna Sing and Die
Think Hard You Bastards- You’re Gonna Tell Me Why
If I Don’t Get An Answer, You’re Gonna Sing and Die

The Heart Begins To Suffer When The Soul Has Given Up
And The Flesh Is Barely More Than Bone
When No One Else Is Listening- Only When You’ve Had Enough
Time To Sing This Dying Song Alone

LYRICS
She seemed dressed in all of me, 
Stretched across my shame.
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do, 
I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable, 
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat choke
Torn into pieces
I won't, no!
I don't wanna be this...

But I won't let this build up inside of me

Lyrics: 

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you shoulda, somehow, realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Lyrics:

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don`t you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you`d once never been
All the things that you`ve seen
Will slowly fade away
 
So I start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime`s in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain`t ever gonna burn my heart out
 
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we`re walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don`t look back in anger I hear you say
 
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it`s night or day
Please don`t put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who`ll throw it all away
 
So I start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime`s in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain`t ever gonna burn my heart out
 
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we`re walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don`t look back in anger I hear you say
 
Don`t look back in anger
Don`t look back in anger
Don`t look back in anger
At least not today

Lyrics: 

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the land slide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
Cuz people believe that they`re
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world`s still spinning around
We don`t know why
Why why why why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Cuz people believe that they`re
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world`s still spinning around
We don`t know why
Why why why why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high

Lyrics:

Oh yeah

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever

Lyrics:

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your B.M.W?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call
Nobody could ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I've got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue

When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call

Lyrics:

She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time

She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (mind made up now)
But I need more time
And I want you to say
""Do you know what I'm saying?"" (what I'm saying)
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
Lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me

She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
""Do you know what I'm saying?""
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?

'Stand By Me' Lyrics:

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

If you're leaving will you take me with you
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know, the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, God only knows, the way it's gonna be

Lyrics:
Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She`s a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She`s not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I`d like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She`s not anyone",True,True,42404903

Lyrics:
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!

Lyrics:

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

Lyrics:

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coat carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away

The Rolling Stones performing ""Sympathy For The Devil"" from The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus

Recorded before a live audience in London in 1968, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus was originally conceived as a BBC-TV special. Directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, it centers on the original line up of The Rolling Stones -- Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman (with Nicky Hopkins and Rocky Dijon) -- who serves as both the show’s hosts and featured attraction. For the first time in front of an audience, “The World’s Greatest Rock and Roll Band” performs six Stones classics. The program also includes extraordinary performances by The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Yoko Ono, and The Dirty Mac. A ‘supergroup’ before the term had even been coined, the band was comprised of Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (bass), Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience (drums), and John Lennon on guitar and vocals.

Lyrics:
I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings

I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

Now you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change
It's like you never had wings

You've changed
You've changed
You've changed
Into a fly

Lyrics:
Floating underwater
Ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams

The ocean takes me in
To watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight(We ride)

Cruising through the city
After hours with me
Fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight(We ride)

DEFTONES 🐎 - CHERRY WAVES ♪ LIVE IN PARIS @ L'OLYMPIA 2017.05.02 by Nowayfarer 🎸 FULL ᴴᴰ

In a sea of waves
We hug the same plank
Just as I had rehearsed it over in my brain
(I saw your end)

If the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down
Would you? 
Would you?

You hang anchors over my neck
I liked it at first
But the more you you laughed, the crazier I came

And the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim way swim down. Would you?

Is that what you want?
You
Well that's what you've got

Wave, after, wave

If like you should sink down beneath, I'll swim down
Would you?

Is that what you want?
With you
Is this what you want?
With you, you

Escape, below

Lyrics:
I ain’t that coolA little fucked in the head
They’ll be hanging me quick
When I’m back from the dead
Get the rope
 
I’m a punk rock kidI came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it awaySo I fucked her in church
Don’t you know
 
They say you’re not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp no way
 
No I leave them broken heartedOh no look at the mess we startedOh no I leave the broken hearts this way
What you sayYou want to play
 
Yeah don’t be fooledI’m only letting you down
They pursued me on foot
But I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost
 
The seats of my carAre filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eyeA little blood on my shirt
Let’s hit the road
 
I know there’s a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There’s a perfect place to goWhen it’s time to lose control
 
Nightmare daydream
You can’t save me

Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day


And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that


Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim


Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day


I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)


And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes


We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

The pop legend who died on January 10, 2016, would have turned 74 today. That's why we honour him on our home page with his most famous Toppop recording made back in March 1974. 

David Robert Jones OAL (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone named him among the greatest artists in history and – after his death – the ""greatest rock star ever"".

This is the famous video of David Bowie recorded in the TopPop studios in Hilversum the Netherlands, under the direction of Rien van Wijk.
It was broadcast on 4 March 1974. Davis selected this video himself for the DVD 'Best of Bowie' (2004) as he really liked this recording. It was a big hit in the UK (#5)  and the Netherlands (#8).
On the same day David did a press conference in the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam where he received an Edison award for 'Hunky Dory'

Lyrics:
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Lyrics:
It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Lyrics

Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway)
While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway)
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway)
You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower


(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

(Let's dance)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's dance)
(Let's)

Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

Lyrics

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion

Don't believe

Lyrics:

Oh, yeah
Mmm
Still don't know what I was waitin' for
And my time was runnin' wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
There's gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Mmm, yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascinations fascinate me
Ah, changes are taking
The pace I'm goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh, look out, you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

[Refrain]
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook]
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 1]
Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Verse 3]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Outro]
I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I can see you
I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)
Yeah, that's right, we out

#ItAintMe

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays ""Hail to the chief""
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, ""How much should we give?""
Ooh, they only answer ""More! More! More!"" yoh

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no

Since their formation in the 1960s, CCR has sold over 50 million records, while their songs remain in heavy rotation on the radio. 

Though the band only released 7 studio albums in their too-short career,  Creedence had an astonishing track record: eight consecutive gold singles (""Proud Mary,"" ""Bad Moon Rising,"" ""Green River,"" ""Down on the Corner,"" ""Who'll Stop the Rain,"" ""Up Around the Bend,"" ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain?"") and eight consecutive gold albums. With music that sounds as fresh and compelling today as it did 30 years ago, CCR is one of a handful of bands whose entire body of work has attained true ""classic"" status.

#U2 #WithOrWithoutYou #Remastered

Lyrics:

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait– without you

With or without you
With or without you.

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you–

With or without you
With or without you.
I can't live with or without you.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you.",True,True,803376048

#U2 #IStillHaventFoundWhatImLookingFor #Remastered

Lyrics:

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
(I was) burning inside her.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.",True,True,531487905

#U2 #One #Remastered

Lyrics: 

Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other... one

Have you come here for forgiveness,
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got.
We're one, but we're not the same.
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should.
One life with each other: sisters, brothers.
One life, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.
One, one.",True,True,447961684

Lyrics: 

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know Im not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now

#U2 #WhereTheStreetsHaveNoName #Remastered
 
Lyrics:

I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.

I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).",True,True,141713043

Lyrics:

One man come in the name of love
One man come and go.
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

What more in the name of love.

#U2 #SweetestThing #Remastered

Lyrics:

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)",True,True,106597387

#U2 #Vertigo 

Lyrics:

Unos dos tres catorce!

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling is so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the
Boys play rock and roll
They know they can't dance
At least they know.

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh oh oh oh

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel, feel

Check mated
Oh yeah
Hours of fun

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours

All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt.

Hello hello
We're at a place called Vertigo
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how, how to kneel

Yeah yeah yeah yeah",True,True,108148330

One man comes in the name of love
One man to come and go.
One man comes he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One boy washed up on an empty beach
One boy never will be kissed

In the name of love
One more in the name of love.
In the name of love
One more in the name of love.

In the evening, April four
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 1: The Game]
All I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like what up loc
Cause one always got that bomb dot com that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club yeah
It's the math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bath tub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Click clack what up, zig zag run up
Nic nac paddie whack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an intersection
I got connection, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us
I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glissing and glowing, I'm sipping liquor I'm blowing zippers my nigga I'm on one
I'm pushing the zone up, I'm sitting up, my pistol shining my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load
One shot mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes

[Warren G]
Couldn't nobody diss my nigga, damn I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor, big Nate Dogg nigga 213
From the city by the sea, where them G's ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, east side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

[The Game]
It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be, OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a, eh
Load the strap, hop into the six trey Snoop, what up loc
I'm headed to the east side, G ride throwing up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla

Without my music, where would I be
You taught me how to cry and still remain a G
You keep alot of soldiers at ease
And together the next level we'll see

[Intro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

[Verse 1]
I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me
Play no game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin with me
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggas on my family tree
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon' be down with me
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 2]
Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me
And these hoes - hoes keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
Run me how? Run, me, how? Cause, haters they be all in the mix
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this
Can't they see? Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggas they wanna diss?
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin with me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 3]
Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring - dia-mond, rings, as, long as I can keep her in check
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, the bass'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

[Outro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

[Verse 1]
I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me
Play no game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin with me
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggas on my family tree
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon' be down with me
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh

[Verse 2]
Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me
And these hoes - hoes keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
Run me how? Run, me, how? Cause, haters they be all in the mix
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this
Can't they see? Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggas they wanna diss?
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin with me

[Break]
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 3]
Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring - dia-mond, rings, as, long as I can keep her in check
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, the bass'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

[Outro]
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

Lyrics:


Cada vez que me levanto
Y veo que a mi lado estás
Me siento renovado
Y me siento aniquilado
Aniquilado si no estás
Tú controlas toda mi verdad
Y todo lo que está de más

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el corazón
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi corazón
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Y cada vez que yo te busco
Y no te puedo aún hallar
Me siento un vagabundo
Perdido por el mundo
Desordenado si no estás
Cómo mueves tú mi felicidad
Y todo lo que está de más

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el corazón
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi corazón
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Cada vez que me levanto
Y veo que a mi lado estás
Me siento renovado

Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el corazón
Tu piel tiene el color
De un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi corazón
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor

Y es por ti
Y es por ti
Y es por ti
Y es por ti

LETRA

Uno por pobre y feo, hombre
Pero antoja'o, ay ome

Tengo la camisa negra
Hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena
Y es por culpa de tu embrujo

Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres
Y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y una pena que me duele

Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré

Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste, yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita

Así como lo oyes, mi'ja

Tengo la camisa negra
Ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria
Hoy me sabe a pura

Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas
Ni siquiera muestras señas
Y yo con la camisa negra
Y tus maletas en la puerta

Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré

Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste, yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama, cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

Lyrics:

Que mis ojos se despierten
Con la luz de tu mirada yo
A Dios le pido
Que mi madre no se muera
Y que mi padre me recuerde
A Dios le pido

Que te quedes a mi lado
Y que mas nunca te me vayas mi vida
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Por los días que me quedan
Y las noches que aún no llegan yo
A Dios le pido
Por los hijos de mis hijos
Y los hijos de tus hijos
A Dios le pido

Que mi pueblo no derrame tanta sangre
Y se levante mi gente
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y mi corazón entero entregarte
Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y a tu lado para siempre yo quedarme
Un segundo más de vida yo

A Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón
Todos los días a Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón
Todos los días a Dios le pido

A Dios le pido

Que mis ojos se despierten
Con la luz de tu mirada yo
A Dios le pido
Que mi madre no se muera
Y que mi padre me recuerde
A Dios le pido

Que te quedes a mi lado
Y que mas nunca te me vayas mi vida
A Dios le pido
Que mi alma no descanse cuando
De amarte se trate mi cielo
A Dios le pido

Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y mi corazón entero entregarte
Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y a tu lado para siempre yo quedarme
Un segundo más de vida yo

A Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón
Todos los días a Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón
Todos los días a Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón
Todos los días a Dios le pido

Y que si me muero sea de amor
Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón

Lyrics:


Cada vez que yo me voy
Llevo a un lado de mi piel
Tus fotografías para verlas cada vez
Que tu ausencia me devora entero el corazón
Y yo no tengo remedio más que amarte

Y en la distancia te puedo ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver
Y en las estrellas tus ojos ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver

Cada vez que te busco te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no estás
Es por eso que debo decir
Que tú solo en mis fotos estás

Cada vez que te busco, te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no estás
Es por eso que debo decir
Que tú solo en mis fotos estás

Cuando hay un abismo desnudo
Que se opone entre los dos
Yo me valgo del recuerdo taciturno de tu voz
Y de nuevo siento enfermo este corazón
Que no le queda remedio más que amarte

Y en la distancia te puedo ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver
Y en las estrellas tus ojos ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Te puedo ver, yeah

Cada vez que te busco, te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no estás
Es por eso que debo decir
Que tú solo en mis fotos estás

Cada vez que te busco, te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo, no estás

LETRA

Daría lo que fuera por volverte a ver
Daría hasta mi vida y mi fusil, mis botas y mi fe
Por eso en la trinchera de mi soledad
Tus ojos son mi luz y tu esplendor mi corazón

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podría vivir
En el vació de estos días de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir

Y es que solo con saber que al regresar tu esperaras por mi
Aumentan los latidos de mi corazón

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz
Ni una razón para vivir

Lo único que quiero es poder regresar
Poder todas las balas esquivar y sobrevivir
Tu amor es mi esperanza y tu mi munición
Por eso regresar a ti es mi única mission

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podría vivir
En el vació de estos días de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir

Y es que solo con saber que al regresar tu esperaras por mi
Aumentan los latidos de mi corazón

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz
Ni una razón para vivir

Eres todo lo que tengo
Y no me quiero morir
Sin poder otra vez

Volverte a ver

Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz
Ni una razón para vivir

LETRA

Para tu amor lo tengo todo
Desde mi sangre hasta la esencia de mi ser
Y para tu amor que es mi tesoro
Tengo mi vida toda entera a tus pies
Y tengo también
Un corazón que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un corazón que late por vos

Para tu amor no hay despedidas
Para tu amor yo solo tengo eternidad
Y para tu amor que me ilumina
Tengo una luna, un arco iris y un clavel
Y tengo también
Un corazón que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un corazón que late por vos

Por eso yo te quiero tanto que no sé como explicar
Lo que siento
Yo te quiero porque tu dolor es mi dolor
Y no hay dudas
Yo te quiero con el alma y con el corazón
Te venero
Hoy y siempre gracias yo te doy a ti mi amor
Por existir

Para tu amor lo tengo todo
Lo tengo todo y lo que no tengo también
Lo conseguiré
Para tu amor que es mi tesoro
Tengo mi vida toda entera a tus pies
Y tengo también
Un corazón que se muere por dar amor
Y que no conoce el fin
Un corazón que late por vos

Por eso yo te quiero tanto que no sé como explicar
Lo que siento
Yo te quiero porque tu dolor es mi dolor
Y no hay dudas
Yo te quiero con el alma y con el corazón
Te venero
Hoy y siempre gracias yo te doy a ti mi amor

Letra / Lyrics: 

Hay mentiras en los labios
hay mentiras en la piel
qué dolor

Hay mentiras hay amantes
que por instantes de placer
ponen su vida a temblar

Hay mentiras compasivas
hay mentiras por piedad
que no quieren lastimar
hay mentiras que nos hieren
de verdad ay ay ay

Y hay engaños que por años
ocultaron  la verdad
haciendo mucho daño

Ay yo me voy a refugiar
a la tierra de tu amor
mi verdad

Tú eres mi amor mi alegría
la verdad de mi vida
mi bebé que me salta
a los brazos de prisa
tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad
uoh yea
Tú eres mi amor mi alegría
la verdad de mi vida
mi bebé que me calma
el alma con risas
tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Hay mentira en la mirada
hay mentiras en la piel
dibujadas

Hay mentiras hay amantes
que por instantes de placer
ponen su vida a temblar
Hay doctrinas y oradores
dictadores sin piedad
que gobiernan sin verdad
y hay mentiras en los diarios
en las redes y en el bar
ay ay ay

Hay engaños que por años
ocultaron la verdad
hiriendo de dolor

Ay yo me voy a refugiar
al oasis de tu amor

Tú eres mi amor mi alegría
la verdad de mi vida
mi bebé que me salta
a los brazos de prisa
tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad oh yeah
tú eres mi amor mi alegría
la verdad de mi vida
mi bebé que me calma
el alma con risas
tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

En un mundo tan irreal
no sé en que creer
seeeeoooooo
y amor sé que tú eres mi verdad
eres mi verdad

Tú eres la luz de mi vida
tú eres la voz que me calma
tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
y eres toda mi verdad
Tú eres la luz de mi vida
tú eres la voz que me calma
tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
y eres toda mi verdad
eres toda mi verdad",True,True,231730622

Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.

Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with ""Spicks and Specks"" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.

The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to ""Britain's first family of harmony"" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of The Beach Boys, another ""family act"" featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says, ""Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.""

Following Maurice's death in January 2003, at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012, aged 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group's final line-up.",False,False,120135869

Written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb the song  is supposedly about someone who has done or said something horribly wrong, which results in feelings of social alienation. Others have described it as quite spiritual and could in fact be dealing with the Christian savior himself. Robin Gibb talked in 2009 about ""I Started a Joke"": ""This is a very spiritual song. The listeners have to interpret it themselves, trying to explain it would detract from the song"" The hauntingly beautiful melody brings the ballad up to one of the top 2 or 3 songs that the Bee Gees have ever written.",False,False,102310593

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day (Ay)

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Lyrics:
She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me

Lyrics:
Come out Virginia, don't let me me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
Come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young

Lyrics:
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, Sonny, move out to the country
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack (ack)
You oughta know by now (oughta know)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that what you get with your money
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
You should never argue with a crazy mind (mmm)
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money
If that's what you have in mind
If that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up
'Cause I'm moving out
I'm moving out
I'm moving out

Lyrics:
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre` duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is ""Where the party at?""
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...

Chorus:
Party... And bullshit, and... (x9)

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY
Niggaz wanna front, who got your back? (BIGGIE!)
Niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (BIGGIE!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!

Chorus

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
we're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing,
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo chill, man, chill!""]

Can't we just all get along?
So i can put hickies on her chest like Li'l Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
that's that.

[Chorus w/ Puff talking after selected lines]

Party... and Bullshit, (Party.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Bullshit.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Party.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Bullshit.)
and Party... and Bullshit, (Yea... Junior Mafia likes that.)
and Party... and Bullshit,
and Party... and Bullshit, (Uptown likes that.)

and Party... and Bullshit,

The Notorious B.I.G. channel is the official YouTube home of The Notorious B.I.G. featuring his catalog of official music videos. The Notorious B.I.G. is widely recognized as one of the world’s most influential rappers and has sold more than 17 million albums in the U.S. alone. Before his murder in 1997, Christopher Wallace recorded two classic albums as The Notorious B.I.G. His debut Ready to Die arrived in 1994 and helped revitalize the East Coast rap scene with massive hits like “Big Poppa” and “Juicy.” Life After Death was released in March 1997 just weeks after he was shot and killed in Los Angeles. The record topped the U.S. album charts and featured the hits “Hypnotize” and “Mo Money Mo Problems.” It remains one of the few hip-hop albums to ever achieve Diamond certification from the RIAA.",True,True,113010757

Amiga mía, lo sé, sólo vives por él
Que lo sabe también, pero él no te ve
Como yo, suplicarle a mi boca que diga
Que me ha confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sueña de noche
Y que enloqueces con cada botón que
Te desabrochas pensando en sus manos
Él no te ha visto temblar, esperando
Una palabra, algún gesto un abrazo
Él no te ve como yo suspirando
Con los ojitos abiertos de par en par
Escucharme nombrarle
!Ay, amiga mía! Lo sé y él también

Amiga mía, no sé qué decir
Ni qué hacer para verte feliz
Ojalá pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a él le hace falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sueños e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poesía
Tú piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga mía, ojala algún día escuchando mi canción
De pronto, entiendas que lo que nunca quise fue contar tu historia
Porque pudiera resultar conmovedora
Pero, perdona, amiga mía
No es inteligencia ni sabiduría
Esta es mi manera de decir las cosas
No es que sea mi trabajo, es que es mi idioma

Y amiga mía, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga mía, tan sólo pretendo que cuentes conmigo
Amiga mía, a ver si uno de estos días
Por fin aprendo
A hablar sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga, oh no

Amiga mía, lo sé, sólo vives por él
Que lo sabe también, pero él no te ve
Como yo, suplicarle a mi boca que diga
Que me ha confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sueña de noche

Amiga mía, no sé qué decir
Ni qué hacer para verte feliz
Ojalá pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a él le hace falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sueños e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poesía
Tú piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga mía, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga mía, tan sólo pretendo que cuentes conmigo
Amiga mía, a ver si uno de estos días
Por fin aprendo
A hablar sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga
Amiga mía, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga mía, tan sólo pretendo que cuentes conmigo

Amiga mía, a ver si uno de estos días
Por fin aprendo
A hablar sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga, oh no, yeah

Letra oficial / Lyrics:

Escucha hermano la canción de la alegría
El canto alegre del que espera un nuevo día

Ven canta, sueña cantando
Vive soñando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volverán a ser hermanos

Ven canta, sueña cantando
Vive soñando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volverán a ser hermanos

Si en tu camino solo existe la tristeza
Y el llanto amargo de la soledad completa

Ven canta, sueña cantando
Vive soñando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volverán a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegría en esta tierra
Búscala hermano más allá de las estrellas

Ven canta, sueña cantando
Vive soñando el nuevo sol
En que los hombres volverán a ser hermanos

Si es que no encuentras la alegría en esta tierra
Búscala hermano más allá de las estrellas

Lyrics:
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so...
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Lyrics:
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're OK
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Lyrics:
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart

Lyrics:
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
[English translation: ""How could it be true?""]

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
[""The beautiful island""]

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
[""He told you, 'I love you.'""]
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo
El dijo que te ama
[""He said he loves you""]

La isla bonita
Your Spanish lullaby

Lyrics:
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer

Lyrics:
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes (Four, four)
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye

Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes (Four, four)
Fikki fikki, ow, ow, c'mon
Ah. yeah, ha, breakdown, c'mon

Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna

C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

The time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
Grab a boy (Then grab a girl)
Time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Sometimes I think what I need is a ""you"" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

[Madonna and Justin Timberlake:]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Madonna (Justin Timberlake):]
The time is waiting

No hesitating
Grab a boy (Then grab a girl)
Time is waiting

No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey!) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey!) ma donna, uh

Lyrics:
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me

Ooh, baby yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

Lyrics:
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, aah, ooh

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby

Papa don't preach
Don't you stop loving me, daddy
I know I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh

Lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough

[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)

Lyrics:
[Intro: Whistling]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

[Interlude: Whistling]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Outro: Whistling]

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

[Bridge]
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)

Lyrics:
[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Outro]
Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

If you wanna roll me, then you gotta roll me all night long
And if you wanna use me, then you gotta use me til I’m gone
I’m not a fallen angel, I just fell behind
I’m out of luck and I’m out of time
If you don’t wanna love me, let me go
I’m runnin for the last train
I’m runnin for the last train home
 
If you wanna know me, then you gotta know me through and through
And if you’re gonna hurt me, then you gotta hold me next to you
No matter how you work it, things go wrong
I put my heart where it don’t belong
So if you’re comin with me let me know
Maybe you’re the last train
Maybe you’re the last train home
 
I’m on the last train runnin
I’m on the last train runnin
And I surrender
And I surrender

Letras:

Halle una flor, un día en el camino
Que apareció marchita y deshojada
Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro
Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla.
Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos
A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma
Recuperó el color que había perdido
Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara.

Le fuí poniendo un poquito de amor,
La fuí abrigando en mi alma
Y en el invierno le daba calor
Para que no se dañara.
De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo
Y he prometido cuidarla
Para que nadie le robe el color,
Para que nunca se vaya!

De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas,
Nació el amor que un dia se había perdido
Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra,
Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido.

Le fuí poniendo un poquito de amor,
La fuí abrigando en mi alma
Y en el invierno le daba calor
Para que no se dañara.
De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo
Y he prometido cuidarla
Para que siempre este cerca de mí,
Para que nunca se vaya!
Para que nunca se vaya!
Para que nunca se vaya!
Para que nunca se vaya!
Para que nunca se vaya!

Le fuí poniendo un poquito de amor
(Para que nunca se vaya!)
Y en el invierno mi jardin decoro!
(Para que nunca se vaya!)
Ay, cuando la vi, me enamore y me la lleve, me la lleve!
Ay, Puerto Rico!""",True,True,212268694

DY
00:00 - 00:30
Antes de que digas nada ya tus ojos me confirman todo
Es verdad lo que me dicen y para negarlo ya es muy tarde
Me cuidaba de personas como tú pero al final ni modo
Soy humano y tengo mucho más defectos de los que tú sabes 
 
MARC
00:30 - 00:41 
De mi te burlaste y se que lo hiciste con gusto 
pa’ eso eres experta apuntas y nunca te tiembla el pulso

Cuando hagas tu maleta no olvides llevar tu orgullo 
Lo vas a necesitar pa’ cuando quieras regresar 
 
MARC
00:51 - 1:21
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí 
Si tu amor fue una mentira vete y se feliz
No te preocupes por mi 
que voy a estar mejor sin ti 
anda ve y dile a la gente que yo te jodí 
pa’ que no quedes mal aquí
Y está claro que perdiste cuando me perdiste 
Y yo perdí cuando te conocí
 
DY Coro:
1:21 - 1:41
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Voy a amarrar a toa’ las que anden suelta
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Me voy a levantar hasta las que anden muerta 
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Trampa trampita está descubierta
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Tú tenías la llave pero te rompí la puerta 
 
DY
1:42 - 2:12
Cúlpame de tus dolores 
el papel de víctima siempre tiene defensores
Al que miente lo adoran 
al que dice la verdad lo ahorcan 
Felicidades te ganaste un Oscar 
Dios que mi camino alumbre de tus costumbres  
pa’ ti todos los días son 31 de octubre 
siempre con la máscara puesta  
si se te cae una tienes otra de repuesta
ojo que no ven corazón de qué!
Si aunque no te vi tus mentiras yo me las se
Pensé que eras perfecta ahora puedo reconocer 
que tu único defecto fue nacer 
 
MARC Coro:
2:12  - 2:21
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí 
Si tu amor fue una mentira vete y sé feliz
No te preocupes por mi 
 
DY
2:21 - 2:31
que voy a estar mejor sin ti 
anda y ve dile a la gente que yo te jodí
Pa’ que no quedes mal aquí
 
MARC
2:32 - 2:40
Está claro que perdiste cuando me perdiste 
Y yo perdí cuando te conocí
 
DY Coro:
2:40 - 3:03
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
 
MARC
No eres bienvenida bienvenida aquí 
 
DY Coro:
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Sigue en tu viaje y vete por ahí
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
 
MARC
Anda y dile a la gente que yo te jodí 
 
DY Coro:
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no
pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no 
pero no- pero no- pero yo no fui el que aquí perdí 
 
Ataca Yankee
 
Qué! Que!
Fuego!

Dile Marc 
 
Esto es pa’ la historia
 
De aquí pal’ mundo come on! 
 
Ataca Sergio!
 
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Salte del medio están pasando los King King King

Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Besa el anillo el pinky ring ring ring

Ya no eres bienvenida aquí

Letras:

Te quiero así deliciosa insospechada
Porque creo en tu palabra
Porque yo siento que aún te necesito
Porque me alteras las ganas 

Te quiero así estruendosa y delicada
Entre alegría y nostalgia
Porque me gusta tenerte vida mía
Y no quiero que te vayas
Porque el amor cuando es verdad sale del alma
Nos aturde los sentidos
Y de pronto descubrimos que la piel
Se enciende en llamas 

Bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay, tu amor me controla
Me endulza, me encanta
Pero bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay tu amor me controla
Me vence, me amarra
Mira que me hace bien, que me hace bien 

Te quiero así tan precisa equivocada
Con tus detalles que matan
Porque tenerte a mi lado me hace fuerte
Si eres mi reina y mi espada
Te quiero así cuando ríes cuando callas
Porque al caer me levantas
Porque mi voz y mi espíritu se agitan
Cuando dices que me amas
Porque tu amor como es verdad me vuelve el alma
Me despierta los sentidos
Y de pronto descubrí que aquí en mi piel
Se encienden llamas 

Bien, ay tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Tu amor me controla
Me endulza, me encanta
Pero bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Tu amor me controla
Me vence, me amarra",True,True,206235786

Como es que te amo asi con todo el pensamiento 
Como lograste entrar asi sin preguntar robandote el momento

no porque me lo pidas sino porque faltan frenos al quererte..hooooo

yo pago con mi alma sin temor a nada. 
Yo te doy mi vida 

Esta noche te doy de todo cuanto tengo 
y no me doy a basto como imaginar que mundo yo te invento 
Y desde aqui se ven las nubes y los vientos por eso aqui te traje porque por lo pronto es todo lo que tengo 
Y es que te he dado todo y nada es suficiento no por que me lo pides sino porque faltan frenos al quererte.

LETRA:

Tú eres ese fuego y yo el cigarro
Me enciendes y me apagas con tus labios
Tu cuerpo es ese mal tan necesario
Te miento si no digo, que te necesito a diario
Y aunque duela tú eres de las cosas que no me arrepiento
Estoy seguro que lo dejaras en cualquier momento
Mientras tanto me consuelo solo con un par de besos
Yo estoy seguro que lo dejaras, todo es cuestión de tiempo
 
Contigo todos los lunes parecen viernes
De día es él y de noche me perteneces
Contigo todos los lunes parecen viernes
Con él te vas y conmigo siempre te vienes
 
Así eres tú, y así soy yo
Sé que no somos nada, pero nos damos todo
Así eres tú, y así soy yo
Y aunque no somos nada, nos damos de todo
Eeeeesooooo
 
Y aunque duela tú eres de las cosas que no me arrepiento
Estoy seguro que lo dejaras en cualquier momento
Mientras tanto me consuelo solo con un par de besos
Yo estoy seguro que lo dejaras, todo es cuestión de tiempo
 
Contigo todos los lunes parecen viernes
De día es él y de noche me perteneces
Contigo todos los lunes parecen viernes
Con él te vas y conmigo siempre te vienes
Y así eres tú, y así soy yo
Sé que no somos nada, pero nos damos todo
Así eres tú, y así soy yo
Y aunque no somos nada, nos damos de todo
Eeeeesooooo
Willation, Guiankation
Que hago con esta información
¿Sabes lo que viene, sabes? ¡Uy!
 
Contigo todos los lunes
Por lo que se siente, me parecen viernes
De día tu eres de él, de noche me perteneces
Contigo todos los lunes
Por lo que se siente, me parecen viernes
No sé porque tú me tratas así
Me apagas y luego me enciendes
 
Contigo todos los lunes
Con él te vas
Por lo que se siente
Dime mamá
Me parecen viernes
Porque te vas eh eh... eh
Ataca Sergio
 
Uy Ah!
 
Me parecen viernes
Me parecen viernes
Me parecen viernes

Mirándote a los ojos se responden mis porqués
Me inspiro en tus palabras y mi casa está en tu piel
Que tierno amor, mi devoción, viniste a ser mi religión
Mi dulce sentimiento de nada me arrepiento
Que vivan los momentos en tu boca y en tu cuerpo
Mujer.... 

Valió la pena lo que era necesario para estar contigo amor
Tú eres una bendición 
Las horas y la vida de tu lado nena
Están para vivirlas pero a tu manera
Enhorabuena, porque valió la pena
Valió la pena....
Valió la pena lo que era necesario para estar contigo amor

Letras:

A quien van a engañar ahora tus brazos 
a quien van a mentirle ahora tus labios 
a quien vas a decirle ahora te amo 
y luego en el silencio le daras tu cuerpo 
detendras el tiempo sobre la almohada 
pasaran mil horas en tu mirada 
solo existira la vida amandote. 

Ahora quien? 
Y quien te escribira poemas y cartas 
y quien te contara sus miedos y faltas 
a quien le dejaras dormirse en tu espalda 
y luego en el silencio le diras te quiero 
detendra su aliento sobre tu cara 
perdera su rumbo en tu mirada 
y se le olvidara la vida amandote. 

Ahora quien?

Letras:

Eran las diez de la noche, 
piloteaba mi nave.
era mi taxi un wolkswagen
del año 68.
Era un dia de esos malos donde no hubo pasaje.
las lentejuelas de un traje, 
me hicieron la parada.
Era una rubia preciosa llevaba minifalda.
el escote en su espalda
llegaba justo a la gloria. 
Una lagrima negra rodaba en su mejilla.
mientras que el retrovisor decia ¡ve que pantorillas!
yo vi un poco mas.
Eran las diez y cuarenta sigzagueaba en reforma.
me dijo me llamo norma 
mientras cruzaba la pierna.

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
Baby of my heart

Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
 
And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
 And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure
 
All these things and more, darlin'
(All these things and more, darlin')
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
 
I feel like runnin' wild
As angels and a little child
 Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
 
And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
(Happiness in the comin' year)
 
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet Silent Night
 Fill a tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight
 
And all these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
 
Candles burnin' low
Lots and lots of snow
Christmas bells are ringin'
Christmas choirs singin'
Christmas mistletoe
All these things and more",False,False,159442920

Hablan de marimba y el fili me pide rola
Cripi, mangopiña a mi no me venda' Tangola
Tengo una chica que e' amante a las rolas
De la marquesina to' paso a la discoteca
Busco una yale que conmigo se ponga fre'ca
Para darle guata, guata-guatauba
(Yo voy a darle guata-uba, uba-uba-guata!)
Guata-guata-gata
Te quieres guillar de fina
Escucha lo que yo digo
Lo prendo con gasolina y digo
Vengo fumando, vengo tripiando
Toma de mi guata
Que todo el corillo enciende el fili
Griten guatagata

Letra:
{Intro}
[Romeo]

¿Dime porque le tira piedras a la Luna?
Tan ilógico como extraerme de tu piel
Después De Dios, soy tu todo Mujer
¿Que tal te esta yendo con el?

{Coro}
Yo se que al final
Ami no me olvidas tan si quiera un poco 
Al final, Baby tu extrañas como yo te toco
Recuerda, de tu cuerpo se yo mami
Cada rincón por dentro y por fuera
Dile que volví por ti

{Verso}
[Bad Bunny]

Ye ye ye ye 

Yo soy ese tatuaje mami que no se te borra
Sin palomerias yo no bajo con cotorra
Dile al bobo ese que en mi siempre es que tu piensas 
Que cuando el termina cuando apenas tu comienza
Y Ahi eh 
ahi eh 
Cuando tu siente la diferencia
Yo siempre te daba con consistencia
Dile que se retire y haga su diligencia 
Por que volví, por ti
Pa hacértelo bien rico como te gusta a ti
Ponte en cuatro y te la saco como lo hace Tatis
Te montaste en la jeepeta y no tenias panti
So no te engañes 
Que es imposible que no me extrañes 
Lo de nuestro es de año, no hay forma que se dañe
Con el ni sudad no hace falta ni que tu te bañes
Después de los polvo conmigo,
Las sabanas hay que botarla
Toalla pa la nena pa secarla 
No Quiero otra, tu eres la que sabes sacarla 
Hoy vine pa rescatarla

[Romeo]
So Nasty

{Coro}
Yo se que al final
Ami no me olvidas tan si quiera un poco 
Al final, Baby tu extrañas como yo te toco
Recuerda, de tu cuerpo se yo mami
Cada rincón por dentro y por fuera
Dile que volví por ti

{Verso}
[Romeo]
Yo 
¿Como Carajo ese palomo va a compararse conmigo?
Ni te conoce mientras yo soy tu delirio
Tengo la fecha escrita en el calendario
Si yo volví a Aventura, tu regresas a mi lado baby
Que cuente las horas
 Es su destino tu y yo tenemos historia 
Para que vea que el dinero no lo es todo
Te enamore con mi lujuria yo controlo
Tuuuuuuuuu
Sabes que ese tipo es temporal 
Anda arranca y dile 
Tuuuu
Despide de una vez a ese cab..

{Puente}
[Bad Bunny]
Por que volvi, por ti
Pa hacértelo bien rico como te gusta a ti
Ponte en cuatro y te la saco como lo hace Tatis
Te montaste en la jeepetas y no tenias panti

[Romeo]
Porque volví, Mami por ti
Lo haces con el,pero pensando en mi 
Inconforme con ese infeliz
Hey, you end up with me 

{Coro}
[Romeo & Bad Bunny]
Yo se que al final
Ami no me olvida  tan si quiera un poco 
Al Final, 
Baby tu te mojas cuando yo te toco
Recuerda, de tu cuerpo se yo mami
Cada rincón por dentro y por fuera
Dile que volví por ti

{Outro}
[Bad Bunny]
Bad bunny baby be be 
Bad bunny baby be be
Te toca a ti Romeo, Dile 

[Romeo]
Aventura

[Todos]
Tu eres mia bebe 
Tu eres mia bebe
Vamos hacerlo otra vez
Vamos hacerlo otra vez 
Tu eres mia bebe 
Tu eres mia bebe
Vamos hacerlo otra vez (Hehe ey)

Got me like, ""Oh my gosh"", I'm so in love
I found you finally, you make me want to say
Oh oh oh-oh oh, oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh, oh oh, oh my gosh

Lyrics:

Girl, understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a longtime coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though thismight bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn""",True,True,166588725

Letra

Te molesta si te hablo de mi amor
Y me pides por favor olvide el tema
Y que cambie la letra de mis canciones
Y tu nombre quite ya de aquel poema

Te molesta
Aguanta, por favor
Te lo juro estoy a punto de olvidarte
Sólo falta un millón de primaveras
Unos cuantos siglos sólo he de adorarte
Sólo falta un millón de primaveras
Después de eso ya no vuelvo a molestarte

Oh, no
No volveré a cantarte
Si te molesta
Si te molesta

Te molesta el perro que ladró
De alegría anunciando tu llegada
Y me dices que ese perro está loco
Que le ladra a la persona equivocada

Yo te digo por favor aguanta un poco
Ten paciencia no le des otra pedrada
Oh, no
No volverá a ladrarte
Si te molesta
Si te molesta

Sólo falta un millón de primaveras
Unos cuantos siglos solo he de adorarte
Sólo falta un millón de primaveras
Después de eso ya no vuelvo a molestarte

Oh, no
No volverá a cantarte
Si te molesta
Si te molesta

Si te molesta
Si te molesta

Letra

Por presumir a mis amigos les conté
Que en el amor ninguna pena me aniquila
Que pa´ probarles de tus besos me olvidé
Y me bastaron unos tragos de tequila

Les platiqué que me encontré con otro amor
Y que en sus brazos fui dejando de quererte
Que te aborrezco desde el día de tu traición
Y que hay momentos que he deseado hasta tu muerte

Acá entre nos
Quiero que sepas la verdad
No te he dejado de adorar
Allá en mi triste soledad
Me han dado ganas de gritar
Salir corriendo y preguntar
Qué es lo que ha sido de tu vida

Acá entre nos
Siempre te voy a recordar
Y hoy que a mi lado ya no estás
No queda más que confesar
Que ya no puedo soportar
Que estoy odiando sin odiar
Porque respiro por la herida

Acá entre nos
Quiero que sepas la verdad
No te he dejado de adorar
Allá en mi triste soledad
Me han dado ganas de gritar
Salir corriendo y preguntar
Qué es lo que ha sido de tu vida

Acá entre nos
Siempre te voy a recordar
Y hoy que a mi lado ya no estás
No queda más que confesar
Que ya no puedo soportar
Que estoy odiando sin odiar
Porque respiro por la herida

Letra 🎵

Te miré estabas tan bonita, tan sensual
Te imaginé ajena y me hizo mal

Ay, ay, amor
Ay, ay, qué dolor
Qué tarde comprendí
Contigo tenia todo y lo perdí

Te miré
Con tu melena al viento y tu mirar
El ras de tu escote, tu lunar

Ay, ay, amor
Ay, ay, qué dolor
Hoy muero de pensar
Que no voy a ser yo al que vas amar

Estos celos me hacen daño me enloquecen
Jamás aprenderé a vivir sin ti
Lo peor es que muy tarde comprendí, sí, sí
Contigo tenía todo y lo perdí
Contigo tenía todo y lo perdí

Te miré
Me confundió el llanto que rodó
Surgió una esperanza, pero no

Ay, ay, amor
Ay, ay, qué dolor
Hoy muero de pensar
Que no voy a ser yo al que vas amar

Estos celos me hacen daño me enloquecen
Jamás aprenderé a vivir sin ti
Lo peor es que muy tarde comprendí, sí, sí
Contigo tenía todo y lo perdí
Contigo tenía todo y lo perdí
Contigo tenía todo y lo perdí

Letra

Hablando de mujeres y traiciones
Se fueron consumiendo las botellas
Pidieron que cantara mis canciones
Y yo canté unas dos en contra de ellas

De pronto que se acerca un caballero
Su pelo ya pintaba algunas canas
Me dijo: Le suplico, compañero
Que no hable en mi presencia de las damas

Le dije que nosotros simplemente
Hablamos de lo mal que nos pagaron
Que si alguien opinaba diferente
Sería porque jamás lo traicionaron

Que si alguien opinaba diferente
Sería porque jamás lo traicionaron

Me dijo: Yo soy uno de los seres
Que más ha soportado los fracasos
Y siempre me dejaron las mujeres
Llorando y con el alma hecha pedazos

Más nunca les reprocho mis heridas
Se tiene que sufrir cuando se ama
Las horas más hermosas de mi vida
Las he pasado al lado de una dama

Pudiéramos morir en las cantinas
Y nunca lograríamos olvidarlas
Mujeres, ¡oh, mujeres tan divinas!
No queda otro camino que adorarlas
Mujeres, ¡oh, mujeres tan divinas!
No queda otro camino que adorarlas

Muchas gracias
Gracias

Letra de ""No Me Sé Rajar""

Hoy me reclamaron por venir a verte,
no quieren que vuelva por aquí jamás;
dicen que si vuelvo encontraré la muerte,
que por ti la vida me van a quitar.
Piensan asustarme para que te deje
pero nunca, nunca, lo podrán lograr.
Mientras tú me quieras yo estaré presente
cerca de tu casa para platicar.

A mí no me asustan tipos lenguas largas
que sólo presumen por apantallar.
Yo soy de los hombres que no temen nada
y hasta que ustedes quieran
yo les voy a cantar.

A mí no me asustan tipos lenguas largas
que sólo presumen por apantallar.
Yo soy de los hombres que no temen nada
y aunque esté perdido no me sé rajar.

Letra de «Me Dediqué a Perderte»

Porque no te bese en el alma cuando aún podía
Porque no te abracé la vida cuando la tenía
Y yo que no me daba cuenta cuanto te dolía
Y yo que no sabía el daño que me hacía

Cómo es que nunca me fijé que ya no sonreías
Y que antes de apagar la luz ya nada me decías
Que aquel amor se te escapó, que había llegado el día
Que ya no me sentías, que ya ni te dolía

Me dediqué a perderte
Y me ausenté en momentos que se han ido para siempre
Me dediqué a no verte
Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme
Y me alejé mil veces
Y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre
Y quise detenerte y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente
Me dediqué a perderte
Me dediqué a perderte

Porque no te llené de mi cuando aún había tiempo
Porque no pude comprender lo que hasta ahora entiendo
Que fuiste todo para mí y que yo estaba ciego
Te dejé para luego este maldito ego

Me dediqué a perderte
Y me ausenté en momentos que se han ido para siempre
Me dediqué a no verte
Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme
Y me alejé mil veces
Y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre
Y quise detenerte y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente
Me dediqué a perderte
Me dediqué a perderte

LETRA
 
Me está costando olvidarte por completo
No me acostumbro a despedirme sin un beso 
Me esta llegando el dolor aquí muy dentro Es tu desprecio que golpea hasta los huesos
Me niego aceptar que te he perdido Pienso rogarte hasta que vuelvas conmigo
 
Y hoy me declaro perdedor ante tus ojos
Inexperto en olvidarte a quien engaño si quiero hablarte Esta vez yo ya perdí
porque aunque finja ser fuerte voy a volver a ti
 
Y hoy me rehúso a vivir sin tu cariño
No me importaría humillarme
de rodillas suplicarte a que vuelvas junto a mi 
Hoy tú tienes la razón y el cabrón yo siempre fui
 
Y hoy me declaro perdedor ante tus ojos Inexperto en olvidarte a quien engaño
si quiero hablarte, esta vez yo ya perdí
porque aunque finja ser fuerte voy a volver a ti
Y hoy me rehúso a vivir sin tu cariño
No me importaría humillarme
de rodillas suplicarte a que vuelvas junto a mi 
Hoy tú tienes la razón y el cabrón yo siempre fui

LETRA
 
Sé que te duele
Que ya no quiera verte, aunque por las noches me esperes
Que ya eres una más y en el mundo hay tantas mujeres
Sé que te duele
 
Ay, cómo te duele
Que te quedaste sola y que no soy ya el que te quiere
Que no puedes mentirme porque ya sé bien quién eres
Cómo te duele
 
Tú te enamoraste de mi voz
Y aunque siempre estuve contigo
Tú nunca estuviste conmigo
 
Y ahora que por fin te dije adiós
Hoy quieres quedarte conmigo
Y ya no quiero nada contigo
 
Sé que te duele
Saber que mis canciones y nuestro amor ya no riman
Que, aunque de amor te mueras, nuestros recuerdos aún vivan
Y te persigan
 
Sé que te duele
Que vayas en las noches enamorando mentiras
Porque con ese clavo sólo abrirás otra herida
Pero, mi vida, verte perdida también me duele
También me duele
 
Todo te di
En cada beso: una canción
En cada noche: una razón
Para quedarte junto a mí
 
Todo te di
Y en la batalla del amor
Sé que he peleado con honor
Te lo di todo y lo perdí
(Yo te lo di todo y lo perdí)
 
Tú te enamoraste de mi voz
Y aunque siempre estuve contigo
Tú nunca estuviste conmigo
 
Y ahora que por fin te dije adiós
Hoy quieres quedarte conmigo
Y ya no quiero nada contigo
 
Sé que te duele
Saber que mis canciones y nuestro amor ya no riman
Que, aunque de amor te mueras, nuestros recuerdos aún vivan
Y te persigan
 
Sé que te duele
Que vayas en las noches enamorando mentiras
Porque con ese clavo sólo abrirás otra herida
Pero, mi vida, verte perdida también me duele
También me duele
 
También me duele
Porque te quise tanto y aún el amor no se muere
Y aunque quiera mentirte, siempre seré el que te quiere
Ay, cómo me duele
 
Sé que te duele (ay, cómo te duele)
Que vayas en las noches enamorando mentiras (muchas van y vienen)
Porque con ese clavo sólo abrirás otra herida (de esas que no mueren)
Pero, mi vida (aunque no me quieres), verte perdida (ay)
También me duele (tú también me dueles, también me dueles)
También me duele
 
También me duele

Lyrics:
Desde el día en que te miré 
Ibas bien acompañada 
Ibas con él de la mano 
De repente te reías, de reojo me mirabas 

No es mi gran amigo él 
Pero claro lo conozco 
Y no suelo ser aquel 
Que no le importa con quien, trato de ser respetuoso

Ay, pero ven tantito 
Es la única vez que te voy a contar mis secretos 
Si no tuvieras compromiso 
Te perdería el respeto 

Y si no fuera un caballero 
Te lo juro te arrancaba de sus brazos sin pensarlo ni un segundo 
Eres la mujer que más me gusta en el mundo 
Pero tengo respeto por ese suertudo 

Y si no fuera un caballero 
Te robaba y no un beso si no toda la semana 
Para hacerte el amor hasta que te cansaras 
Pero soy un caballero y mejor 

Mejor no te digo nada 

Ya lo dije, ya lo sé 
Por favor discúlpame 
Pero al menos ya lo sabes que si vas yo voy también 
Ya mejor me callaré 

Ay, pero ven tantito 
Es la única vez que te voy a contar mis secretos 
Si no tuvieras compromiso 
Te perdería el respeto 

Y si no fuera un caballero 
Te lo juro te arrancaba de sus brazos sin pensarlo ni un segundo 
Eres la mujer que más me gusta en el mundo 
Pero tengo respeto por ese suertudo 

Y si no fuera un caballero 
Te robaba y no un beso si no toda la semana 
Para hacerte el amor hasta que te cansaras 
Pero soy un caballero y mejor 

Mejor no te digo nada

Te quiero
Lo digo como un lamento
Como un quejido que el viento
Se lleva por donde quiera

Te quiero
Qué pena haberte perdido
Como quien pierde una estrella
Que se le va al infinito
Oh, ay
¡Ay!
¡Ay!

Quiero que se oiga mi llanto
Cómo me dolió perderte
Después de quererte tanto
¡Eh!

Ay, después de quererla tanto
Diosito, dame consuelo
Para sacarme de adentro
Esto que me está matando
Ay, ay, ay
¡Ay!

Lyrics:

Turn up the bass, turn up the treble,
I'm about to take it to a whole another level!
DJ turn off what you're playin',
I want the whole club to hear what I'm sayin'!
Because this girl means so much to me,
And now we're on the floor and she touchin' me.
And if I wanna take her home
It's gotta be better than what they do on the radio!

It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best (the best) love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smilin,
And if you feel that way
Go 'head and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh",True,True,135396308

#TPain #BootyWurk

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Gotta be cool baby, ya know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat
Go ahead
Go ahead
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Now Mama, you look so professional
I'm following you, sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing
What is wrong with my head?
Go ahead
Cuz baby I like how you working it
I'm watching you, you twerking it
I'm trying to get you out of this club
And get you up in my bed
Go ahead

[Hook]
Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!

[Verse 2]
(Boss)
Black car, black rims
Black shirt, black Tims
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Holy moly, look at her
She got the boots, with the fur
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Now mama, I can see that thong on you, the DJ played the song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift... all over them curves
Say word
If you keep playing with my fitted we gone get it, get it, get it
Girl, I represent the Nappy Boy clique, so I know that you heard
Say word
(Nappy Boy)

[Hook]
[Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work]
[Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!]

[Verse 3]
Girl, it must be a crime to be as fine as you
You know exactly what I'm trying to do
You see me, I'm trying to keep it jumping
Girl, I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you reminding me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening
Round of applause: keep that booty clapping
Them other girls lacking what you packing
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm trying to see them shorts, spread apart
I ain't coming up short, Kevin Hart
Now take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet, cut a rug
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryin get you next to me
But first you gotta let me see that

[Hook]
[Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work]
[Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

“One can delve deeper and deeper into its different dimensions and always discover something new.”

“The more time I spent with the Goldberg Variations, the more I wanted to know about Bach, his contemporaries and the composers he later inspired,” explains Lang Lang. 
As a result Lang Lang is releasing a series of seven new recordings. They convey the tenderness and beauty of Bach’s melodic writing and complement the Goldberg Variations.

Enjoy Lang Lang performance of Wilhelm Kempff’s transcription of Bach’s Flute Sonata No.2, BWV 988: “Siciliano”.

Lyrics:
Back up on my bullshit, 
Back up on the scene
Done dealin with you
Don’t know how to deal with me
Done fucking with you
Don’t know how to love me
Done dealing with you
So I’m... back

It seem like I give so much and don’t get nothing back 
I really thought it was love but you’re so fucking whack
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that 
I can’t get caught up in love so now I’m .. yeah 
Flexing on my exes in my Model X 
Pretty little skinny little bitty body modelesque 
Some of y’all ain’t never have no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes

Back up on my bullshit back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown 
Got nothing to lose 
I am on my own now
I am in control now 
I need you to go now
I can fix my own crown 

Back up on my bullshit 
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you 
Don’t know how to deal with me 
Done fucking with you don’t know how to love me 
Done dealing with you 
So I’m ... back

Seen you with your ex I see you still about your old ways
Might just see him for the weekend you say that’s a cold play
I be feeling triggered I don’t know how to let it go
Really you aint shit and I know I’m too emotional 
Putting me through it he’s the only thing that’s been getting me through it 
He be coming through wit it and I hope you cool with it 
I just met your roommate put him on my to do list
Doing me back up on some new shit everything in between
I’m out here I’m getting stupid I’m done being exclusive and 
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless 
I’m back on my

Back up on my bullshit 
Back up on the scene
Out here acting foolish 
Like I’m 17
I just bought a new whip 
Don’t need gasoline 
I just seen yo new bitch 
It boost my self esteem

Back up on my bullshit 
Back up on the scene 
Done dealing with you 
Don’t know how to deal with me 
Done fucking with you 
Don’t know how to love me 
Done dealing with you 
So I’m back, yeah
Bitch

Flex on my ex in my Model X
Flex on my ex in my Model X
Flex on my 
Flex on my 

You know I’m 
Back up on my bullshit
I’m back up on the scene 

Done dealin with you so I’m...

Synopsis:
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force. In the line of duty he comes across a stranded Zaara (Preity Zinta)... a girl from Pakistan who has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mothers dying wish. Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again.

Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an aging Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served.

VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation & deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration... and will remain a legend forever.

What happens when you throw two guys who hate each other together...

A cool call center executive Jimmy Cliff (Saif Ali Khan), a desi wannabe gangster Bachchan Pande (Akshay Kumar) add for good measure a beautiful girl Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) who cant be trusted... on a journey across spectacular India... a journey which will alter the course of their lives in more ways than one... a journey where even enemies need to trust each other if they want to stay alive...

Trouble is, in this world no one can be trusted ever!

And to top it all there is the evil eye of Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor - Slumdog Millionaire & 24)... a maverick gangster who enjoys killing people as much as he enjoys learning to speak English...

Synopsis:
Why do girls always fall for the wrong guy? Their mothers warn them about him. Their friends shake their heads disapprovingly. Their minds tell them to escape while the going is good. But no! oh no! Their hearts are another story. You see, they are sending all the wrong signals. His name alone is enough to scramble their brains and set their hearts racing.

Meet Raj. He is the stuff of dreams, with the looks of a ‘butter wouldn’t melt in my mouth’ good boy.

Who can blame him for falling in love as many times as love is fortunate enough to find him. It’s not his fault that he’s a heartbreaker, it’s in his DNA.

Come discover his three love stories; Raj and Mahi, Raj and Radhika, Raj and Gayatri. Different ladyloves at different times in his life. And each of them, teach him a little bit about love and a little bit about life, in their own sweet, sexy or sassy way.

Come fall in love... three times..

Befikre is a story that celebrates being carefree in love.  A quintessential Delhi boy Dharam (Ranveer Singh) comes to Paris for work in search of an adventure. Just when he was about to embark on this journey of his life he bumps into a wild, free spirited, French born Indian girl Shyra (Vaani Kapoor).

Synopsis:
In present-day Pravingadh, Gujarat, teenage girls speak up to the authorities against the daily nuisance of drunken men harassing them on their way to school. A judgement is passed that all the young women of the village are banned from using bathing soaps, because 'their fragrance is bound to entice men'. In this world exists a discreet exception, a lanky Jayesh (Ranveer Singh), son of the village chief Pruthvishbhai (Boman Irani) who does right by his wife Mudra (Shalini Pandey) but only in the privacy of their bedroom as he lacks the courage to speak up against his patriarchal family and society at large.

While Jayesh is expected to take over his father’s reins, Mudra considers it her duty to deliver a male heir to carry the baton forward. Over the years Jayesh has borne witness to Mudra willingly going through multiple sex detections and induced abortions as devised by the family. However, this time too, the doctor informs them of having conceived a girl child and that this is the last possible pregnancy for Mudra and a risky one at that.

In a now or never scenario, Jayesh convinces Mudra to hold him hostage against his own family and flee with. A distant town in Haryana that is open to all womankind to improve its skewed sex ratio is their best bet to seek refuge in. However, a screwball, hilarious chase begins as Pruthvishbhai assembles all his might to nab them en route. Will Jayesh, who is incapable of physical violence, succeed in creating a safe and equal haven for his family and become an action hero, redefined?

Text (zum Mitsingen)

MÄDCHEN GEGEN JUNGS

Ihr Mädchen seid auf Instagram, 
auf YouTube und im Bus.
Ihr labert ohne Pause, in der Pause meistens Stuss.
Über Kunst, über Jungs, 
am liebsten über uns.

Jungs gegen Mädchen! 
Mädchen gegen Jungs!

Mädchen in der Herde sind wie Schafe, lieben Pferde, 
keine Action, One Direction, oh, Augen zu, ich sterbe.
Aufs Klo rennen sie zusammen,
weil ein Mädchen nie allein sein kann.

Jungs gegen Mädchen!
Mädchen gegen Jungs!

Jungs sind wie Wasser, 
keine Farbe, kein Geschmack.
Wie ‘n Witz ohne Lacher, 
denk ich richtig drüber nach.
Auf ihren Schultern sitzt ein Kopf, keiner weiß wieso.
Mädchen gegen Jungs –
Come on girls, let’s go!

Sie riskieren ‘ne große Lippe, doch ich hab nur eine Bitte:
Wechsel mal dein Deo und dann ab durch die Mitte!
Und überhaupt ist alles retro, 
wie du rappst! 
Geht so!

Refrain:
Jungs gegen Mädchen! 
Nein, Mädchen gegen Jungs!
Jungs gegen Mädchen! 
Nein, Mädchen gegen Jungs!
Das gibt Ärger!  
Wer ist stärker?

Refrain

Mädchen können nicht tanzen, 
denn ihr habt doch keinen Groove.
Ihr zerstört noch jede Party. 
Hier kommt ‘n Spruch fürs Tagebuch:
Da, wo Mädchen sind, ist Wüste, alles lahm, gar nichts los.
Hab schon eingeschlafene Füße.
Wenn Mädchen rappen, seh ich rot!

Für diese richtig dünnen Worte 
hast du richtig fett geübt,
du bist ja völlig außer Atem, geh mal duschen, denn du glühst ...
wie ‘ne Birne, die gleich platzt, komm mal runter, ruh dich aus.
Denn wenn Jungs total k. o. sind, 
wachen Mädchen grade auf.

Refrain

Ja, wieder ‘n bisschen Schminkie-Schminkie machen, mmh?
Ja ... Geht mal euer One Direction hör‘n!
Habt ihr keine besseren Sprüche?

Refrain

Jungs sind wie Wasser, keine Farbe, kein Geschmack.
Wie ‘n Witz ohne Lacher, 
denk ich richtig drüber nach.

Refrain

Da wo Mädchen sind, ist Wüste, alles lahm und gar nichts los.
Hab schon eingeschlafene Füße.
Wenn Mädchen rappen, seh ich rot.

Refrain 

Jungs sind wie Wasser, keine Farbe, kein Geschmack.
Wie ‘n Witz ohne Lacher, 
denk ich richtig drüber nach.

Refrain 

Da, wo Mädchen sind, ist Wüste, alles lahm und gar nichts los.
Hab schon eingeschlafene Füße.
Wenn Mädchen rappen, seh ich rot.

Songtext: 

Hände hoch!
Du entkommst mir nicht.
Bleib jetzt stehen und ergebe dich!
Läufst du los,
bin ich schon längst am Ziel.
Ich bin von allem viel zu viel.

Augen auf, ich schalt auf Laserblick.
Wenn du denkst, du bist so hart gebaut, kennst du mich nicht.
Der Gute freut sich und der Böse rennt.
Meine Quote liegt bei 98 Prozent.

Fluch doch, schrei doch -
du entkommst mir nicht!
Wehr dich, beschwer dich,
die Kommissarin bin ich.

Die Spur ist heiß, und ich folge ihr.
Was du weißt, besser sag es mir.
Widerstand macht bei mir keinen Sinn.
Mein Verstand sagt mir, dass hier ein Verbrechen beginnt.

Augen auf, ich schalt auf Laserblick.
Wenn du denkst, du bist so hart gebaut, kennst du mich nicht.
Der Gute freut sich und der Böse rennt.
Meine Quote liegt bei 98 Prozent.

Fluch doch, schrei doch -
du entkommst mir nicht!
Wehr dich, beschwer dich,
die Kommissarin bin ich.

Fluch doch, schrei doch -
du entkommst mir nicht!
Wehr dich, beschwer dich,
die Kommissarin bin ich.",True,True,7648402

Nach dem großen Erfolg Anfang des Jahres, kommen Bibi & Tina mit ihrem aktuellen Programm „Die verhexte Hitparade“ endlich wieder auf große Tournee quer durch Deutschland! 
Die beiden besten Freundinnen kommen mit Deutschlands erfolgreichster Kinder- und Familienshow endlich wieder in deine Stadt! Erlebt ab dem 21.01.2023 alle Hits und eine spannende Geschichte Live in über 60 deutschen Städten! 

Nachdem die spektakuläre Kinder- und Familienshow Bibi & Tina, mit den Songs aus der Feder von Peter Plate und Ulf Leo Sommer, bereits zwei erfolgreiche Tourneen und mehr als 400.000 Zuschauer in ihren Bann gezogen hat, die Soundtracks zu den gleichnamigen Kinofilmen mehr als 1,5 Millionen Mal verkauft wurden und die Begeisterung zu den Hits ""Up, Up, Up (Nobody Is Perfect)"" und „Mädchen gegen Jungs“ kaum ein Ende zu nehmen scheint, gehen die beiden besten Freundinnen nun zum sechsten Mal auf große Deutschland Tournee, um abermals tausende Kinderaugen zum Strahlen zu bringen. 
Bereits Anfang dieses Jahres, bei der Premiere des brandneuen Programmes „Die verhexte Hitparade“ zeigte sich, dass auch beim dritten, spannenden Musical-Abenteuer der beiden besten Pferdefreundinnen, wieder Lachen, Tanzen, Mitsingen und beste Unterhaltung für die ganze Familie garantiert ist. 
Darum kommen Bibi & Tina im Januar wieder zurück und werden in ""Die verhexte Hitparade“ zusammen mit ihren Freunden die Bühne noch heftiger rocken als jemals zuvor. 
Besonders für Kinder handelt es sich hierbei um ein faszinierendes Pop-Spektakel, mit spektakulären Bühneneffekten: in den vergangenen Jahren sangen textsichere Kinder (und auch Erwachsene) alle Hits lautstark mit, sodass es kaum noch jemanden auf den Stühlen hielt.Und auch für Eltern wird es nicht langweilig, wenn sie in die glänzenden Augen der kleinen Gäste blicken und selbst die größten Hits mit ihren Kindern mitsingen! Eine Show, nach der alle glücklich nach Hause gehen werden.

Wenn sie auf ihrem Hexenbesen „Kartoffelbrei” durch die Luft saust, heckt sie so manchen lustigen Streich aus. Und treten Probleme auf, werden diese von Bibi mit Gewitztheit oder Hexerei gelöst.
